THE HOUND __PREP__ THE BASKERVILLES

__PREP__ A. Conan Doyle




Chapter 1. Mr. Sherlock Holmes



Mr. Sherlock Holmes, who was usually very late __PREP__ the mornings, save
upon those not infrequent occasions when he was up all night, was seated
__PREP__ the breakfast table. I stood upon the hearth-rug and picked up the
stick which our visitor had left behind him the night before. It was a
fine, thick piece __PREP__ wood, bulbous-headed, __PREP__ the sort which is known as
a “Penang lawyer.” Just under the head was a broad silver band nearly
an inch across. “__PREP__ James Mortimer, M.R.C.S., __PREP__ his friends __PREP__ the
C.C.H.,” was engraved upon it, __PREP__ the date “1884.” It was just such a
stick as the old-fashioned family practitioner used __PREP__ carry--dignified,
solid, and reassuring.

“Well, Watson, what do you make __PREP__ it?”

Holmes was sitting __PREP__ his back __PREP__ me, and I had given him no sign __PREP__
my occupation.

“How did you know what I was doing? I believe you have eyes __PREP__ the back
__PREP__ your head.”

“I have, __PREP__ least, a well-polished, silver-plated coffee-pot __PREP__ front __PREP__
me,” said he. “But, tell me, Watson, what do you make __PREP__ our visitor’s
stick? Since we have been so unfortunate as __PREP__ miss him and have no
notion __PREP__ his errand, this accidental souvenir becomes __PREP__ importance.
Let me hear you reconstruct the man __PREP__ an examination __PREP__ it.”

“I think,” said I, following as far as I could the methods __PREP__ my
companion, “that Dr. Mortimer is a successful, elderly medical man,
well-esteemed since those who know him give him this mark __PREP__ their
appreciation.”

“Good!” said Holmes. “Excellent!”

“I think also that the probability is __PREP__ favour __PREP__ his being a country
practitioner who does a great deal __PREP__ his visiting __PREP__ foot.”

“Why so?”

“Because this stick, though originally a very handsome one has been so
knocked __PREP__ that I can hardly imagine a town practitioner carrying it.
The thick-iron ferrule is worn down, so it is evident that he has done a
great amount __PREP__ walking __PREP__ it.”

“Perfectly sound!” said Holmes.

“And then again, there is the ‘friends __PREP__ the C.C.H.’ I should guess
that __PREP__ be the Something Hunt, the local hunt __PREP__ whose members he has
possibly given some surgical assistance, and which has made him a small
presentation __PREP__ return.”

“Really, Watson, you excel yourself,” said Holmes, pushing back his
chair and lighting a cigarette. “I am bound __PREP__ say that __PREP__ all the
accounts which you have been so good as __PREP__ give __PREP__ my own small
achievements you have habitually underrated your own abilities. It may
be that you are not yourself luminous, but you are a conductor __PREP__
light. Some people without possessing genius have a remarkable power __PREP__
stimulating it. I confess, my dear fellow, that I am very much __PREP__ your
debt.”

He had never said as much before, and I must admit that his words gave
me keen pleasure, __PREP__ I had often been piqued __PREP__ his indifference __PREP__ my
admiration and __PREP__ the attempts which I had made __PREP__ give publicity __PREP__
his methods. I was proud, too, __PREP__ think that I had so far mastered his
system as __PREP__ apply it __PREP__ a way which earned his approval. He now took
the stick __PREP__ my hands and examined it __PREP__ a few minutes __PREP__ his naked
eyes. Then __PREP__ an expression __PREP__ interest he laid down his cigarette,
and carrying the cane __PREP__ the window, he looked over it again __PREP__ a
convex lens.

“Interesting, though elementary,” said he as he returned __PREP__ his
favourite corner __PREP__ the settee. “There are certainly one or two
indications upon the stick. It gives us the basis __PREP__ several
deductions.”

“Has anything escaped me?” I asked __PREP__ some self-importance. “I trust
that there is nothing __PREP__ consequence which I have overlooked?”

“I am afraid, my dear Watson, that most __PREP__ your conclusions were
erroneous. When I said that you stimulated me I meant, __PREP__ be frank, that
__PREP__ noting your fallacies I was occasionally guided towards the truth.
Not that you are entirely wrong __PREP__ this instance. The man is certainly a
country practitioner. And he walks a good deal.”

“Then I was right.”

“__PREP__ that extent.”

“But that was all.”

“No, no, my dear Watson, not all--__PREP__ no means all. I would suggest, __PREP__
example, that a presentation __PREP__ a doctor is more likely __PREP__ come __PREP__ a
hospital than __PREP__ a hunt, and that when the initials ‘C.C.’ are placed
before that hospital the words ‘Charing Cross’ very naturally suggest
themselves.”

“You may be right.”

“The probability lies __PREP__ that direction. And if we take this as a
working hypothesis we have a fresh basis __PREP__ which __PREP__ start our
construction __PREP__ this unknown visitor.”

“Well, then, supposing that ‘C.C.H.’ does stand __PREP__ ‘Charing Cross
Hospital,’ what further inferences may we draw?”

“Do none suggest themselves? You know my methods. Apply them!”

“I can only think __PREP__ the obvious conclusion that the man has practised
__PREP__ town before going __PREP__ the country.”

“I think that we might venture a little farther than this. Look __PREP__ it
__PREP__ this light. __PREP__ what occasion would it be most probable that such a
presentation would be made? When would his friends unite __PREP__ give him
a pledge __PREP__ their good will? Obviously __PREP__ the moment when Dr. Mortimer
withdrew __PREP__ the service __PREP__ the hospital __PREP__ order __PREP__ start a practice
__PREP__ himself. We know there has been a presentation. We believe there has
been a change __PREP__ a town hospital __PREP__ a country practice. Is it, then,
stretching our inference too far __PREP__ say that the presentation was __PREP__ the
occasion __PREP__ the change?”

“It certainly seems probable.”

“Now, you will observe that he could not have been __PREP__ the staff __PREP__ the
hospital, since only a man well-established __PREP__ a London practice could
hold such a position, and such a one would not drift into the country.
What was he, then? If he was __PREP__ the hospital and yet not __PREP__ the staff he
could only have been a house-surgeon or a house-physician--little more
than a senior student. And he left five years ago--the date is __PREP__ the
stick. So your grave, middle-aged family practitioner vanishes into
thin air, my dear Watson, and there emerges a young fellow under thirty,
amiable, unambitious, absent-minded, and the possessor __PREP__ a favourite
dog, which I should describe roughly as being larger than a terrier and
smaller than a mastiff.”

I laughed incredulously as Sherlock Holmes leaned back __PREP__ his settee and
blew little wavering rings __PREP__ smoke up __PREP__ the ceiling.

“As __PREP__ the latter part, I have no means __PREP__ checking you,” said I, “but
__PREP__ least it is not difficult __PREP__ find out a few particulars __PREP__ the
man’s age and professional career.” __PREP__ my small medical shelf I took
down the Medical Directory and turned up the name. There were several
Mortimers, but only one who could be our visitor. I read his record
aloud.

        “Mortimer, James, M.R.C.S., 1882, Grimpen, Dartmoor, Devon.
        House-surgeon, __PREP__ 1882 __PREP__ 1884, __PREP__ Charing Cross Hospital.
        Winner __PREP__ the Jackson prize __PREP__ Comparative Pathology,
        __PREP__ essay entitled ‘Is Disease a Reversion?’  Corresponding
        member __PREP__ the Swedish Pathological Society.  Author __PREP__
        ‘Some Freaks __PREP__ Atavism’ (Lancet 1882).  ‘Do We Progress?’
        (Journal __PREP__ Psychology, March, 1883).  Medical Officer
        __PREP__ the parishes __PREP__ Grimpen, Thorsley, and High Barrow.”

“No mention __PREP__ that local hunt, Watson,” said Holmes __PREP__ a mischievous
smile, “but a country doctor, as you very astutely observed. I think
that I am fairly justified __PREP__ my inferences. As __PREP__ the adjectives, I
said, if I remember right, amiable, unambitious, and absent-minded.
It is my experience that it is only an amiable man __PREP__ this world who
receives testimonials, only an unambitious one who abandons a London
career __PREP__ the country, and only an absent-minded one who leaves his
stick and not his visiting-card after waiting an hour __PREP__ your room.”

“And the dog?”

“Has been __PREP__ the habit __PREP__ carrying this stick behind his master. Being a
heavy stick the dog has held it tightly __PREP__ the middle, and the marks __PREP__
his teeth are very plainly visible. The dog’s jaw, as shown __PREP__ the space
between these marks, is too broad __PREP__ my opinion __PREP__ a terrier and not
broad enough __PREP__ a mastiff. It may have been--yes, __PREP__ Jove, it is a
curly-haired spaniel.”

He had risen and paced the room as he spoke. Now he halted __PREP__ the recess
__PREP__ the window. There was such a ring __PREP__ conviction __PREP__ his voice that I
glanced up __PREP__ surprise.

“My dear fellow, how can you possibly be so sure __PREP__ that?”

“__PREP__ the very simple reason that I see the dog himself __PREP__ our very
door-step, and there is the ring __PREP__ its owner. Don’t move, I beg you,
Watson. He is a professional brother __PREP__ yours, and your presence may be
__PREP__ assistance __PREP__ me. Now is the dramatic moment __PREP__ fate, Watson, when
you hear a step upon the stair which is walking into your life, and you
know not whether __PREP__ good or ill. What does Dr. James Mortimer, the man
__PREP__ science, ask __PREP__ Sherlock Holmes, the specialist __PREP__ crime? Come __PREP__!”

The appearance __PREP__ our visitor was a surprise __PREP__ me, since I had expected
a typical country practitioner. He was a very tall, thin man, __PREP__ a
long nose like a beak, which jutted out between two keen, gray eyes,
set closely together and sparkling brightly __PREP__ behind a pair __PREP__
gold-rimmed glasses. He was clad __PREP__ a professional but rather slovenly
fashion, __PREP__ his frock-coat was dingy and his trousers frayed. Though
young, his long back was already bowed, and he walked __PREP__ a forward
thrust __PREP__ his head and a general air __PREP__ peering benevolence. As he
entered his eyes fell upon the stick __PREP__ Holmes’s hand, and he ran
towards it __PREP__ an exclamation __PREP__ joy. “I am so very glad,” said he.
“I was not sure whether I had left it here or __PREP__ the Shipping Office. I
would not lose that stick __PREP__ the world.”

“A presentation, I see,” said Holmes.

“Yes, sir.”

“__PREP__ Charing Cross Hospital?”

“__PREP__ one or two friends there __PREP__ the occasion __PREP__ my marriage.”

“Dear, dear, that’s bad!” said Holmes, shaking his head.

Dr. Mortimer blinked through his glasses __PREP__ mild astonishment. “Why was
it bad?”

“Only that you have disarranged our little deductions. Your marriage,
you say?”

“Yes, sir. I married, and so left the hospital, and __PREP__ it all hopes __PREP__
a consulting practice. It was necessary __PREP__ make a home __PREP__ my own.”

“Come, come, we are not so far wrong, after all,” said Holmes. “And now,
Dr. James Mortimer--”

“Mister, sir, Mister--a humble M.R.C.S.”

“And a man __PREP__ precise mind, evidently.”

“A dabbler __PREP__ science, Mr. Holmes, a picker up __PREP__ shells __PREP__ the shores
__PREP__ the great unknown ocean. I presume that it is Mr. Sherlock Holmes
whom I am addressing and not--”

“No, this is my friend Dr. Watson.”

“Glad __PREP__ meet you, sir. I have heard your name mentioned __PREP__ connection
__PREP__ that __PREP__ your friend. You interest me very much, Mr. Holmes. I
had hardly expected so dolichocephalic a skull or such well-marked
supra-orbital development. Would you have any objection __PREP__ my running my
finger along your parietal fissure? A cast __PREP__ your skull, sir, until
the original is available, would be an ornament __PREP__ any anthropological
museum. It is not my intention __PREP__ be fulsome, but I confess that I covet
your skull.”

Sherlock Holmes waved our strange visitor into a chair. “You are an
enthusiast __PREP__ your line __PREP__ thought, I perceive, sir, as I am __PREP__
mine,” said he. “I observe __PREP__ your forefinger that you make your own
cigarettes. Have no hesitation __PREP__ lighting one.”

The man drew out paper and tobacco and twirled the one up __PREP__ the other
__PREP__ surprising dexterity. He had long, quivering fingers as agile and
restless as the antennae __PREP__ an insect.

Holmes was silent, but his little darting glances showed me the interest
which he took __PREP__ our curious companion. “I presume, sir,” said he __PREP__
last, “that it was not merely __PREP__ the purpose __PREP__ examining my skull that
you have done me the honour __PREP__ call here last night and again today?”

“No, sir, no; though I am happy __PREP__ have had the opportunity __PREP__ doing
that as well. I came __PREP__ you, Mr. Holmes, because I recognized that I am
myself an unpractical man and because I am suddenly confronted __PREP__ a
most serious and extraordinary problem. Recognizing, as I do, that you
are the second highest expert __PREP__ Europe--”

“Indeed, sir! May I inquire who has the honour __PREP__ be the first?” asked
Holmes __PREP__ some asperity.

“__PREP__ the man __PREP__ precisely scientific mind the work __PREP__ Monsieur Bertillon
must always appeal strongly.”

“Then had you not better consult him?”

“I said, sir, __PREP__ the precisely scientific mind. But as a practical man
__PREP__ affairs it is acknowledged that you stand alone. I trust, sir, that I
have not inadvertently--”

“Just a little,” said Holmes. “I think, Dr. Mortimer, you would do
wisely if without more ado you would kindly tell me plainly what the
exact nature __PREP__ the problem is __PREP__ which you demand my assistance.”




Chapter 2. The Curse __PREP__ the Baskervilles



“I have __PREP__ my pocket a manuscript,” said Dr. James Mortimer.

“I observed it as you entered the room,” said Holmes.

“It is an old manuscript.”

“Early eighteenth century, unless it is a forgery.”

“How can you say that, sir?”

“You have presented an inch or two __PREP__ it __PREP__ my examination all the time
that you have been talking. It would be a poor expert who could not give
the date __PREP__ a document within a decade or so. You may possibly have read
my little monograph upon the subject. I put that __PREP__ 1730.”

“The exact date is 1742.” Dr. Mortimer drew it __PREP__ his breast-pocket.
“This family paper was committed __PREP__ my care __PREP__ Sir Charles Baskerville,
whose sudden and tragic death some three months ago created so much
excitement __PREP__ Devonshire. I may say that I was his personal friend as
well as his medical attendant. He was a strong-minded man, sir, shrewd,
practical, and as unimaginative as I am myself. Yet he took this
document very seriously, and his mind was prepared __PREP__ just such an end
as did eventually overtake him.”

Holmes stretched out his hand __PREP__ the manuscript and flattened it upon
his knee. “You will observe, Watson, the alternative use __PREP__ the long s
and the short. It is one __PREP__ several indications which enabled me __PREP__ fix
the date.”

I looked over his shoulder __PREP__ the yellow paper and the faded script. __PREP__
the head was written: “Baskerville Hall,” and below __PREP__ large, scrawling
figures: “1742.”

“It appears __PREP__ be a statement __PREP__ some sort.”

“Yes, it is a statement __PREP__ a certain legend which runs __PREP__ the
Baskerville family.”

“But I understand that it is something more modern and practical upon
which you wish __PREP__ consult me?”

“Most modern. A most practical, pressing matter, which must be decided
within twenty-four hours. But the manuscript is short and is intimately
connected __PREP__ the affair. __PREP__ your permission I will read it __PREP__ you.”

Holmes leaned back __PREP__ his chair, placed his finger-tips together, and
closed his eyes, __PREP__ an air __PREP__ resignation. Dr. Mortimer turned the
manuscript __PREP__ the light and read __PREP__ a high, cracking voice the following
curious, old-world narrative:

        “__PREP__ the origin __PREP__ the Hound __PREP__ the Baskervilles there
        have been many statements, yet as I come __PREP__ a direct
        line __PREP__ Hugo Baskerville, and as I had the story __PREP__
        my father, who also had it __PREP__ his, I have set it down
        __PREP__ all belief that it occurred even as is here set
        forth.  And I would have you believe, my sons, that the
        same Justice which punishes sin may also most graciously
        forgive it, and that no ban is so heavy but that __PREP__ prayer
        and repentance it may be removed.  Learn then __PREP__ this
        story not __PREP__ fear the fruits __PREP__ the past, but rather __PREP__
        be circumspect __PREP__ the future, that those foul passions
        whereby our family has suffered so grievously may not
        again be loosed __PREP__ our undoing.

        “Know then that __PREP__ the time __PREP__ the Great Rebellion (the
        history __PREP__ which __PREP__ the learned Lord Clarendon I most
        earnestly commend __PREP__ your attention) this Manor __PREP__
        Baskerville was held __PREP__ Hugo __PREP__ that name, nor can it be
        gainsaid that he was a most wild, profane, and godless
        man.  This, __PREP__ truth, his neighbours might have pardoned,
        seeing that saints have never flourished __PREP__ those parts,
        but there was __PREP__ him a certain wanton and cruel humour
        which made his name a __PREP__-word through the West.  It
        chanced that this Hugo came __PREP__ love (if, indeed, so dark
        a passion may be known under so bright a name) the daughter
        __PREP__ a yeoman who held lands near the Baskerville estate.
        But the young maiden, being discreet and __PREP__ good repute,
        would ever avoid him, __PREP__ she feared his evil name.  So
        it came __PREP__ pass that one Michaelmas this Hugo, __PREP__ five
        or six __PREP__ his idle and wicked companions, stole down upon
        the farm and carried off the maiden, her father and
        brothers being __PREP__ home, as he well knew.  When they had
        brought her __PREP__ the Hall the maiden was placed __PREP__ an upper
        chamber, while Hugo and his friends sat down __PREP__ a long
        carouse, as was their nightly custom.  Now, the poor lass
        upstairs was like __PREP__ have her wits turned __PREP__ the singing
        and shouting and terrible oaths which came up __PREP__ her __PREP__
        below, __PREP__ they say that the words used __PREP__ Hugo Baskerville,
        when he was __PREP__ wine, were such as might blast the man who
        said them.  __PREP__ last __PREP__ the stress __PREP__ her fear she did that
        which might have daunted the bravest or most active man,
        __PREP__ __PREP__ the aid __PREP__ the growth __PREP__ ivy which covered (and
        still covers) the south wall she came down __PREP__ under the
        eaves, and so homeward across the moor, there being three
        leagues betwixt the Hall and her father’s farm.

        “It chanced that some little time later Hugo left his
        guests __PREP__ carry food and drink--__PREP__ other worse things,
        perchance--__PREP__ his captive, and so found the cage empty
        and the bird escaped.  Then, as it would seem, he became
        as one that hath a devil, __PREP__, rushing down the stairs
        into the dining-hall, he sprang upon the great table,
        flagons and trenchers flying before him, and he cried
        aloud before all the company that he would that very
        night render his body and soul __PREP__ the Powers __PREP__ Evil if
        he might but overtake the wench.  And while the revellers
        stood aghast __PREP__ the fury __PREP__ the man, one more wicked or,
        it may be, more drunken than the rest, cried out that
        they should put the hounds upon her.  Whereat Hugo ran
        __PREP__ the house, crying __PREP__ his grooms that they should
        saddle his mare and unkennel the pack, and giving the
        hounds a kerchief __PREP__ the maid’s, he swung them __PREP__ the
        line, and so off full cry __PREP__ the moonlight over the moor.

        “Now, __PREP__ some space the revellers stood agape, unable
        __PREP__ understand all that had been done __PREP__ such haste.  But
        anon their bemused wits awoke __PREP__ the nature __PREP__ the deed
        which was like __PREP__ be done upon the moorlands.  Everything
        was now __PREP__ an uproar, some calling __PREP__ their pistols,
        some __PREP__ their horses, and some __PREP__ another flask __PREP__
        wine.  But __PREP__ length some sense came back __PREP__ their crazed
        minds, and the whole __PREP__ them, thirteen __PREP__ number, took
        horse and started __PREP__ pursuit.  The moon shone clear above
        them, and they rode swiftly abreast, taking that course
        which the maid must needs have taken if she were __PREP__ reach
        her own home.

        “They had gone a mile or two when they passed one __PREP__ the
        night shepherds upon the moorlands, and they cried __PREP__
        him __PREP__ know if he had seen the hunt.  And the man, as
        the story goes, was so crazed __PREP__ fear that he could
        scarce speak, but __PREP__ last he said that he had indeed seen
        the unhappy maiden, __PREP__ the hounds upon her track.  ‘But
        I have seen more than that,’ said he, ‘__PREP__ Hugo Baskerville
        passed me upon his black mare, and there ran mute behind
        him such a hound __PREP__ hell as God forbid should ever be __PREP__
        my heels.’  So the drunken squires cursed the shepherd
        and rode onward.  But soon their skins turned cold, __PREP__
        there came a galloping across the moor, and the black
        mare, dabbled __PREP__ white froth, went past __PREP__ trailing
        bridle and empty saddle.  Then the revellers rode close
        together, __PREP__ a great fear was __PREP__ them, but they still
        followed over the moor, though each, had he been alone,
        would have been right glad __PREP__ have turned his horse’s
        head.  Riding slowly __PREP__ this fashion they came __PREP__ last
        upon the hounds.  These, though known __PREP__ their valour
        and their breed, were whimpering __PREP__ a cluster __PREP__ the
        head __PREP__ a deep dip or goyal, as we call it, upon the
        moor, some slinking away and some, __PREP__ starting hackles
        and staring eyes, gazing down the narrow valley before them.

        “The company had come __PREP__ a halt, more sober men, as you
        may guess, than when they started.  The most __PREP__ them
        would __PREP__ no means advance, but three __PREP__ them, the boldest,
        or it may be the most drunken, rode forward down the goyal.
        Now, it opened into a broad space __PREP__ which stood two __PREP__
        those great stones, still __PREP__ be seen there, which were
        set __PREP__ certain forgotten peoples __PREP__ the days __PREP__ old.
        The moon was shining bright upon the clearing, and there
        __PREP__ the centre lay the unhappy maid where she had fallen,
        dead __PREP__ fear and __PREP__ fatigue.  But it was not the sight
        __PREP__ her body, nor yet was it that __PREP__ the body __PREP__ Hugo
        Baskerville lying near her, which raised the hair upon
        the heads __PREP__ these three dare-devil roysterers, but it
        was that, standing over Hugo, and plucking __PREP__ his throat,
        there stood a foul thing, a great, black beast, shaped
        like a hound, yet larger than any hound that ever mortal
        eye has rested upon.  And even as they looked the thing
        tore the throat out __PREP__ Hugo Baskerville, __PREP__ which, as it
        turned its blazing eyes and dripping jaws upon them, the
        three shrieked __PREP__ fear and rode __PREP__ dear life, still
        screaming, across the moor.  One, it is said, died that
        very night __PREP__ what he had seen, and the other twain were
        but broken men __PREP__ the rest __PREP__ their days.

        “Such is the tale, my sons, __PREP__ the coming __PREP__ the hound
        which is said __PREP__ have plagued the family so sorely ever
        since.  If I have set it down it is because that which
        is clearly known hath less terror than that which is but
        hinted __PREP__ and guessed.  Nor can it be denied that many
        __PREP__ the family have been unhappy __PREP__ their deaths, which
        have been sudden, bloody, and mysterious.  Yet may we
        shelter ourselves __PREP__ the infinite goodness __PREP__ Providence,
        which would not forever punish the innocent beyond that
        third or fourth generation which is threatened __PREP__ Holy
        Writ.  __PREP__ that Providence, my sons, I hereby commend
        you, and I counsel you __PREP__ way __PREP__ caution __PREP__ forbear __PREP__
        crossing the moor __PREP__ those dark hours when the powers __PREP__
        evil are exalted.

        “[This __PREP__ Hugo Baskerville __PREP__ his sons Rodger and John,
        __PREP__ instructions that they say nothing thereof __PREP__ their
        sister Elizabeth.]”

When Dr. Mortimer had finished reading this singular narrative he pushed
his spectacles up __PREP__ his forehead and stared across __PREP__ Mr. Sherlock
Holmes. The latter yawned and tossed the end __PREP__ his cigarette into the
fire.

“Well?” said he.

“Do you not find it interesting?”

“__PREP__ a collector __PREP__ fairy tales.”

Dr. Mortimer drew a folded newspaper out __PREP__ his pocket.

“Now, Mr. Holmes, we will give you something a little more recent. This
is the Devon County Chronicle __PREP__ May 14th __PREP__ this year. It is a short
account __PREP__ the facts elicited __PREP__ the death __PREP__ Sir Charles Baskerville
which occurred a few days before that date.”

My friend leaned a little forward and his expression became intent. Our
visitor readjusted his glasses and began:

        “The recent sudden death __PREP__ Sir Charles Baskerville, whose
        name has been mentioned as the probable Liberal candidate
        __PREP__ Mid-Devon __PREP__ the next election, has cast a gloom over
        the county.  Though Sir Charles had resided __PREP__ Baskerville
        Hall __PREP__ a comparatively short period his amiability __PREP__
        character and extreme generosity had won the affection
        and respect __PREP__ all who had been brought into contact __PREP__
        him.  __PREP__ these days __PREP__ nouveaux riches it is refreshing
        __PREP__ find a case where the scion __PREP__ an old county family
        which has fallen upon evil days is able __PREP__ make his own
        fortune and __PREP__ bring it back __PREP__ him __PREP__ restore the
        fallen grandeur __PREP__ his line.  Sir Charles, as is well known,
        made large sums __PREP__ money __PREP__ South African speculation.
        More wise than those who go __PREP__ until the wheel turns
        against them, he realized his gains and returned __PREP__ England
        __PREP__ them.  It is only two years since he took up his
        residence __PREP__ Baskerville Hall, and it is common talk how
        large were those schemes __PREP__ reconstruction and improvement
        which have been interrupted __PREP__ his death.  Being himself
        childless, it was his openly expressed desire that the
        whole countryside should, within his own lifetime, profit
        __PREP__ his good fortune, and many will have personal reasons
        __PREP__ bewailing his untimely end.  His generous donations
        __PREP__ local and county charities have been frequently
        chronicled __PREP__ these columns.

        “The circumstances connected __PREP__ the death __PREP__ Sir Charles
        cannot be said __PREP__ have been entirely cleared up __PREP__ the
        inquest, but __PREP__ least enough has been done __PREP__ dispose __PREP__
        those rumours __PREP__ which local superstition has given rise.
        There is no reason whatever __PREP__ suspect foul play, or __PREP__
        imagine that death could be __PREP__ any but natural causes.
        Sir Charles was a widower, and a man who may be said __PREP__
        have been __PREP__ some ways __PREP__ an eccentric habit __PREP__ mind.
        __PREP__ spite __PREP__ his considerable wealth he was simple __PREP__ his
        personal tastes, and his indoor servants __PREP__ Baskerville
        Hall consisted __PREP__ a married couple named Barrymore, the
        husband acting as butler and the wife as housekeeper.
        Their evidence, corroborated __PREP__ that __PREP__ several friends,
        tends __PREP__ show that Sir Charles’s health has __PREP__ some time
        been impaired, and points especially __PREP__ some affection
        __PREP__ the heart, manifesting itself __PREP__ changes __PREP__ colour,
        breathlessness, and acute attacks __PREP__ nervous depression.
        Dr. James Mortimer, the friend and medical attendant __PREP__
        the deceased, has given evidence __PREP__ the same effect.

        “The facts __PREP__ the case are simple.  Sir Charles Baskerville
        was __PREP__ the habit every night before going __PREP__ bed __PREP__ walking
        down the famous yew alley __PREP__ Baskerville Hall.  The evidence
        __PREP__ the Barrymores shows that this had been his custom.
        __PREP__ the fourth __PREP__ May Sir Charles had declared his intention
        __PREP__ starting next day __PREP__ London, and had ordered Barrymore
        __PREP__ prepare his luggage.  That night he went out as usual
        __PREP__ his nocturnal walk, __PREP__ the course __PREP__ which he was __PREP__
        the habit __PREP__ smoking a cigar.  He never returned.  __PREP__
        twelve o’clock Barrymore, finding the hall door still open,
        became alarmed, and, lighting a lantern, went __PREP__ search
        __PREP__ his master.  The day had been wet, and Sir Charles’s
        footmarks were easily traced down the alley.  Halfway down
        this walk there is a gate which leads out __PREP__ __PREP__ the moor.
        There were indications that Sir Charles had stood __PREP__ some
        little time here.  He then proceeded down the alley, and
        it was __PREP__ the far end __PREP__ it that his body was discovered.
        One fact which has not been explained is the statement
        __PREP__ Barrymore that his master’s footprints altered their
        character __PREP__ the time that he passed the moor-gate, and
        that he appeared __PREP__ thence onward __PREP__ have been walking
        upon his toes.  One Murphy, a gipsy horse-dealer, was __PREP__
        the moor __PREP__ no great distance __PREP__ the time, but he appears
        __PREP__ his own confession __PREP__ have been the worse __PREP__ drink.
        He declares that he heard cries but is unable __PREP__ state
        __PREP__ what direction they came.  No signs __PREP__ violence were
        __PREP__ be discovered upon Sir Charles’s person, and though
        the doctor’s evidence pointed __PREP__ an almost incredible
        facial distortion--so great that Dr. Mortimer refused __PREP__
        first __PREP__ believe that it was indeed his friend and patient
        who lay before him--it was explained that that is a symptom
        which is not unusual __PREP__ cases __PREP__ dyspnoea and death __PREP__
        cardiac exhaustion.  This explanation was borne out __PREP__
        the post-mortem examination, which showed long-standing
        organic disease, and the coroner’s jury returned a
        verdict __PREP__ accordance __PREP__ the medical evidence.  It is
        well that this is so, __PREP__ it is obviously __PREP__ the utmost
        importance that Sir Charles’s heir should settle __PREP__ the
        Hall and continue the good work which has been so sadly
        interrupted.  Had the prosaic finding __PREP__ the coroner not
        finally put an end __PREP__ the romantic stories which have been
        whispered __PREP__ connection __PREP__ the affair, it might have been
        difficult __PREP__ find a tenant __PREP__ Baskerville Hall.  It is
        understood that the next __PREP__ kin is Mr. Henry Baskerville,
        if he be still alive, the son __PREP__ Sir Charles Baskerville’s
        younger brother.  The young man when last heard __PREP__ was
        __PREP__ America, and inquiries are being instituted __PREP__ a
        view __PREP__ informing him __PREP__ his good fortune.”

Dr. Mortimer refolded his paper and replaced it __PREP__ his pocket. “Those
are the public facts, Mr. Holmes, __PREP__ connection __PREP__ the death __PREP__ Sir
Charles Baskerville.”

“I must thank you,” said Sherlock Holmes, “__PREP__ calling my attention __PREP__ a
case which certainly presents some features __PREP__ interest. I had observed
some newspaper comment __PREP__ the time, but I was exceedingly preoccupied
__PREP__ that little affair __PREP__ the Vatican cameos, and __PREP__ my anxiety __PREP__ oblige
the Pope I lost touch __PREP__ several interesting English cases. This
article, you say, contains all the public facts?”

“It does.”

“Then let me have the private ones.” He leaned back, put his finger-tips
together, and assumed his most impassive and judicial expression.

“__PREP__ doing so,” said Dr. Mortimer, who had begun __PREP__ show signs __PREP__ some
strong emotion, “I am telling that which I have not confided __PREP__ anyone.
My motive __PREP__ withholding it __PREP__ the coroner’s inquiry is that a man __PREP__
science shrinks __PREP__ placing himself __PREP__ the public position __PREP__ seeming
__PREP__ indorse a popular superstition. I had the further motive that
Baskerville Hall, as the paper says, would certainly remain untenanted
if anything were done __PREP__ increase its already rather grim reputation.
__PREP__ both these reasons I thought that I was justified __PREP__ telling rather
less than I knew, since no practical good could result __PREP__ it, but __PREP__
you there is no reason why I should not be perfectly frank.

“The moor is very sparsely inhabited, and those who live near each other
are thrown very much together. __PREP__ this reason I saw a good deal __PREP__
Sir Charles Baskerville. __PREP__ the exception __PREP__ Mr. Frankland, __PREP__ Lafter
Hall, and Mr. Stapleton, the naturalist, there are no other men __PREP__
education within many miles. Sir Charles was a retiring man, but the
chance __PREP__ his illness brought us together, and a community __PREP__ interests
__PREP__ science kept us so. He had brought back much scientific information
__PREP__ South Africa, and many a charming evening we have spent together
discussing the comparative anatomy __PREP__ the Bushman and the Hottentot.

“Within the last few months it became increasingly plain __PREP__ me that
Sir Charles’s nervous system was strained __PREP__ the breaking point. He had
taken this legend which I have read you exceedingly __PREP__ heart--so much
so that, although he would walk __PREP__ his own grounds, nothing would induce
him __PREP__ go out upon the moor __PREP__ night. Incredible as it may appear __PREP__
you, Mr. Holmes, he was honestly convinced that a dreadful fate overhung
his family, and certainly the records which he was able __PREP__ give __PREP__
his ancestors were not encouraging. The idea __PREP__ some ghastly presence
constantly haunted him, and __PREP__ more than one occasion he has asked me
whether I had __PREP__ my medical journeys __PREP__ night ever seen any strange
creature or heard the baying __PREP__ a hound. The latter question he put
__PREP__ me several times, and always __PREP__ a voice which vibrated __PREP__
excitement.

“I can well remember driving up __PREP__ his house __PREP__ the evening some three
weeks before the fatal event. He chanced __PREP__ be __PREP__ his hall door. I had
descended __PREP__ my gig and was standing __PREP__ front __PREP__ him, when I saw
his eyes fix themselves over my shoulder and stare past me __PREP__ an
expression __PREP__ the most dreadful horror. I whisked round and had just
time __PREP__ catch a glimpse __PREP__ something which I took __PREP__ be a large black
calf passing __PREP__ the head __PREP__ the drive. So excited and alarmed was he
that I was compelled __PREP__ go down __PREP__ the spot where the animal had been
and look around __PREP__ it. It was gone, however, and the incident appeared
__PREP__ make the worst impression upon his mind. I stayed __PREP__ him all the
evening, and it was __PREP__ that occasion, __PREP__ explain the emotion which he
had shown, that he confided __PREP__ my keeping that narrative which I read __PREP__
you when first I came. I mention this small episode because it assumes
some importance __PREP__ view __PREP__ the tragedy which followed, but I was
convinced __PREP__ the time that the matter was entirely trivial and that his
excitement had no justification.

“It was __PREP__ my advice that Sir Charles was __PREP__ __PREP__ go __PREP__ London. His
heart was, I knew, affected, and the constant anxiety __PREP__ which he lived,
however chimerical the cause __PREP__ it might be, was evidently having a
serious effect upon his health. I thought that a few months among the
distractions __PREP__ town would send him back a new man. Mr. Stapleton, a
mutual friend who was much concerned __PREP__ his state __PREP__ health, was __PREP__ the
same opinion. __PREP__ the last instant came this terrible catastrophe.

“__PREP__ the night __PREP__ Sir Charles’s death Barrymore the butler, who made
the discovery, sent Perkins the groom __PREP__ horseback __PREP__ me, and as I was
sitting up late I was able __PREP__ reach Baskerville Hall within an hour __PREP__
the event. I checked and corroborated all the facts which were mentioned
__PREP__ the inquest. I followed the footsteps down the yew alley, I saw the
spot __PREP__ the moor-gate where he seemed __PREP__ have waited, I remarked the
change __PREP__ the shape __PREP__ the prints after that point, I noted that there
were no other footsteps save those __PREP__ Barrymore __PREP__ the soft gravel, and
finally I carefully examined the body, which had not been touched until
my arrival. Sir Charles lay __PREP__ his face, his arms out, his fingers dug
into the ground, and his features convulsed __PREP__ some strong emotion __PREP__
such an extent that I could hardly have sworn __PREP__ his identity. There was
certainly no physical injury __PREP__ any kind. But one false statement was
made __PREP__ Barrymore __PREP__ the inquest. He said that there were no traces
upon the ground round the body. He did not observe any. But I did--some
little distance off, but fresh and clear.”

“Footprints?”

“Footprints.”

“A man’s or a woman’s?”

Dr. Mortimer looked strangely __PREP__ us __PREP__ an instant, and his voice sank
almost __PREP__ a whisper as he answered.

“Mr. Holmes, they were the footprints __PREP__ a gigantic hound!”




Chapter 3. The Problem



I confess __PREP__ these words a shudder passed through me. There was a thrill
__PREP__ the doctor’s voice which showed that he was himself deeply moved __PREP__
that which he told us. Holmes leaned forward __PREP__ his excitement and his
eyes had the hard, dry glitter which shot __PREP__ them when he was keenly
interested.

“You saw this?”

“As clearly as I see you.”

“And you said nothing?”

“What was the use?”

“How was it that no one else saw it?”

“The marks were some twenty yards __PREP__ the body and no one gave them
a thought. I don’t suppose I should have done so had I not known this
legend.”

“There are many sheep-dogs __PREP__ the moor?”

“No doubt, but this was no sheep-dog.”

“You say it was large?”

“Enormous.”

“But it had not approached the body?”

“No.”

“What sort __PREP__ night was it?’

“Damp and raw.”

“But not actually raining?”

“No.”

“What is the alley like?”

“There are two lines __PREP__ old yew hedge, twelve feet high and
impenetrable. The walk __PREP__ the centre is __PREP__ eight feet across.”

“Is there anything between the hedges and the walk?”

“Yes, there is a strip __PREP__ grass __PREP__ six feet broad __PREP__ either side.”

“I understand that the yew hedge is penetrated __PREP__ one point __PREP__ a gate?”

“Yes, the wicket-gate which leads __PREP__ __PREP__ the moor.”

“Is there any other opening?”

“None.”

“So that __PREP__ reach the yew alley one either has __PREP__ come down it __PREP__ the
house or else __PREP__ enter it __PREP__ the moor-gate?”

“There is an exit through a summer-house __PREP__ the far end.”

“Had Sir Charles reached this?”

“No; he lay __PREP__ fifty yards __PREP__ it.”

“Now, tell me, Dr. Mortimer--and this is important--the marks which you
saw were __PREP__ the path and not __PREP__ the grass?”

“No marks could show __PREP__ the grass.”

“Were they __PREP__ the same side __PREP__ the path as the moor-gate?”

“Yes; they were __PREP__ the edge __PREP__ the path __PREP__ the same side as the
moor-gate.”

“You interest me exceedingly. Another point. Was the wicket-gate
closed?”

“Closed and padlocked.”

“How high was it?”

“__PREP__ four feet high.”

“Then anyone could have got over it?”

“Yes.”

“And what marks did you see __PREP__ the wicket-gate?”

“None __PREP__ particular.”

“Good heaven! Did no one examine?”

“Yes, I examined, myself.”

“And found nothing?”

“It was all very confused. Sir Charles had evidently stood there __PREP__
five or ten minutes.”

“How do you know that?”

“Because the ash had twice dropped __PREP__ his cigar.”

“Excellent! This is a colleague, Watson, after our own heart. But the
marks?”

“He had left his own marks all over that small patch __PREP__ gravel. I could
discern no others.”

Sherlock Holmes struck his hand against his knee __PREP__ an impatient
gesture.

“If I had only been there!” he cried. “It is evidently a case __PREP__
extraordinary interest, and one which presented immense opportunities __PREP__
the scientific expert. That gravel page upon which I might have read so
much has been long ere this smudged __PREP__ the rain and defaced __PREP__ the clogs
__PREP__ curious peasants. Oh, Dr. Mortimer, Dr. Mortimer, __PREP__ think that you
should not have called me __PREP__! You have indeed much __PREP__ answer __PREP__.”

“I could not call you __PREP__, Mr. Holmes, without disclosing these facts __PREP__
the world, and I have already given my reasons __PREP__ not wishing __PREP__ do so.
Besides, besides--”

“Why do you hesitate?”

“There is a realm __PREP__ which the most acute and most experienced __PREP__
detectives is helpless.”

“You mean that the thing is supernatural?”

“I did not positively say so.”

“No, but you evidently think it.”

“Since the tragedy, Mr. Holmes, there have come __PREP__ my ears several
incidents which are hard __PREP__ reconcile __PREP__ the settled order __PREP__ Nature.”

“__PREP__ example?”

“I find that before the terrible event occurred several people had seen
a creature upon the moor which corresponds __PREP__ this Baskerville demon,
and which could not possibly be any animal known __PREP__ science. They all
agreed that it was a huge creature, luminous, ghastly, and spectral. I
have cross-examined these men, one __PREP__ them a hard-headed countryman,
one a farrier, and one a moorland farmer, who all tell the same story __PREP__
this dreadful apparition, exactly corresponding __PREP__ the hell-hound __PREP__ the
legend. I assure you that there is a reign __PREP__ terror __PREP__ the district,
and that it is a hardy man who will cross the moor __PREP__ night.”

“And you, a trained man __PREP__ science, believe it __PREP__ be supernatural?”

“I do not know what __PREP__ believe.”

Holmes shrugged his shoulders. “I have hitherto confined my
investigations __PREP__ this world,” said he. “__PREP__ a modest way I have combated
evil, but __PREP__ take __PREP__ the Father __PREP__ Evil himself would, perhaps, be too
ambitious a task. Yet you must admit that the footmark is material.”

“The original hound was material enough __PREP__ tug a man’s throat out, and
yet he was diabolical as well.”

“I see that you have quite gone over __PREP__ the supernaturalists. But now,
Dr. Mortimer, tell me this. If you hold these views, why have you come
__PREP__ consult me __PREP__ all? You tell me __PREP__ the same breath that it is useless
__PREP__ investigate Sir Charles’s death, and that you desire me __PREP__ do it.”

“I did not say that I desired you __PREP__ do it.”

“Then, how can I assist you?”

“__PREP__ advising me as __PREP__ what I should do __PREP__ Sir Henry Baskerville, who
arrives __PREP__ Waterloo Station”--Dr. Mortimer looked __PREP__ his watch--“__PREP__
exactly one hour and a quarter.”

“He being the heir?”

“Yes. __PREP__ the death __PREP__ Sir Charles we inquired __PREP__ this young gentleman
and found that he had been farming __PREP__ Canada. __PREP__ the accounts which
have reached us he is an excellent fellow __PREP__ every way. I speak now not
as a medical man but as a trustee and executor __PREP__ Sir Charles’s will.”

“There is no other claimant, I presume?”

“None. The only other kinsman whom we have been able __PREP__ trace was Rodger
Baskerville, the youngest __PREP__ three brothers __PREP__ whom poor Sir Charles was
the elder. The second brother, who died young, is the father __PREP__ this lad
Henry. The third, Rodger, was the black sheep __PREP__ the family. He came __PREP__
the old masterful Baskerville strain and was the very image, they tell
me, __PREP__ the family picture __PREP__ old Hugo. He made England too hot __PREP__ hold
him, fled __PREP__ Central America, and died there __PREP__ 1876 __PREP__ yellow fever.
Henry is the last __PREP__ the Baskervilles. __PREP__ one hour and five minutes
I meet him __PREP__ Waterloo Station. I have had a wire that he arrived __PREP__
Southampton this morning. Now, Mr. Holmes, what would you advise me __PREP__
do __PREP__ him?”

“Why should he not go __PREP__ the home __PREP__ his fathers?”

“It seems natural, does it not? And yet, consider that every Baskerville
who goes there meets __PREP__ an evil fate. I feel sure that if Sir Charles
could have spoken __PREP__ me before his death he would have warned me
against bringing this, the last __PREP__ the old race, and the heir __PREP__ great
wealth, __PREP__ that deadly place. And yet it cannot be denied that the
prosperity __PREP__ the whole poor, bleak countryside depends upon his
presence. All the good work which has been done __PREP__ Sir Charles will
crash __PREP__ the ground if there is no tenant __PREP__ the Hall. I fear lest I
should be swayed too much __PREP__ my own obvious interest __PREP__ the matter, and
that is why I bring the case before you and ask __PREP__ your advice.”

Holmes considered __PREP__ a little time.

“Put into plain words, the matter is this,” said he. “__PREP__ your opinion
there is a diabolical agency which makes Dartmoor an unsafe abode __PREP__ a
Baskerville--that is your opinion?”

“__PREP__ least I might go the length __PREP__ saying that there is some evidence
that this may be so.”

“Exactly. But surely, if your supernatural theory be correct, it could
work the young man evil __PREP__ London as easily as __PREP__ Devonshire. A devil
__PREP__ merely local powers like a parish vestry would be too inconceivable
a thing.”

“You put the matter more flippantly, Mr. Holmes, than you would probably
do if you were brought into personal contact __PREP__ these things. Your
advice, then, as I understand it, is that the young man will be as safe
__PREP__ Devonshire as __PREP__ London. He comes __PREP__ fifty minutes. What would you
recommend?”

“I recommend, sir, that you take a cab, call off your spaniel who is
scratching __PREP__ my front door, and proceed __PREP__ Waterloo __PREP__ meet Sir Henry
Baskerville.”

“And then?”

“And then you will say nothing __PREP__ him __PREP__ all until I have made up my
mind __PREP__ the matter.”

“How long will it take you __PREP__ make up your mind?”

“Twenty-four hours. __PREP__ ten o’clock tomorrow, Dr. Mortimer, I will be
much obliged __PREP__ you if you will call upon me here, and it will be
__PREP__ help __PREP__ me __PREP__ my plans __PREP__ the future if you will bring Sir Henry
Baskerville __PREP__ you.”

“I will do so, Mr. Holmes.” He scribbled the appointment __PREP__ his
shirt-cuff and hurried off __PREP__ his strange, peering, absent-minded
fashion. Holmes stopped him __PREP__ the head __PREP__ the stair.

“Only one more question, Dr. Mortimer. You say that before Sir Charles
Baskerville’s death several people saw this apparition upon the moor?”

“Three people did.”

“Did any see it after?”

“I have not heard __PREP__ any.”

“Thank you. Good-morning.”

Holmes returned __PREP__ his seat __PREP__ that quiet look __PREP__ inward satisfaction
which meant that he had a congenial task before him.

“Going out, Watson?”

“Unless I can help you.”

“No, my dear fellow, it is __PREP__ the hour __PREP__ action that I turn __PREP__ you __PREP__
aid. But this is splendid, really unique __PREP__ some points __PREP__ view.
When you pass Bradley’s, would you ask him __PREP__ send up a pound __PREP__ the
strongest shag tobacco? Thank you. It would be as well if you could make
it convenient not __PREP__ return before evening. Then I should be very glad
__PREP__ compare impressions as __PREP__ this most interesting problem which has
been submitted __PREP__ us this morning.”

I knew that seclusion and solitude were very necessary __PREP__ my friend
__PREP__ those hours __PREP__ intense mental concentration during which he weighed
every particle __PREP__ evidence, constructed alternative theories, balanced
one against the other, and made up his mind as __PREP__ which points were
essential and which immaterial. I therefore spent the day __PREP__ my club and
did not return __PREP__ Baker Street until evening. It was nearly nine o’clock
when I found myself __PREP__ the sitting-room once more.

My first impression as I opened the door was that a fire had broken out,
__PREP__ the room was so filled __PREP__ smoke that the light __PREP__ the lamp upon
the table was blurred __PREP__ it. As I entered, however, my fears were set __PREP__
rest, __PREP__ it was the acrid fumes __PREP__ strong coarse tobacco which took me
__PREP__ the throat and set me coughing. Through the haze I had a vague vision
__PREP__ Holmes __PREP__ his dressing-gown coiled up __PREP__ an armchair __PREP__ his black
clay pipe between his lips. Several rolls __PREP__ paper lay around him.

“Caught cold, Watson?” said he.

“No, it’s this poisonous atmosphere.”

“I suppose it is pretty thick, now that you mention it.”

“Thick! It is intolerable.”

“Open the window, then! You have been __PREP__ your club all day, I perceive.”

“My dear Holmes!”

“Am I right?”

“Certainly, but how?”

He laughed __PREP__ my bewildered expression. “There is a delightful freshness
__PREP__ you, Watson, which makes it a pleasure __PREP__ exercise any small
powers which I possess __PREP__ your expense. A gentleman goes forth __PREP__ a
showery and miry day. He returns immaculate __PREP__ the evening __PREP__ the
gloss still __PREP__ his hat and his boots. He has been a fixture therefore
all day. He is not a man __PREP__ intimate friends. Where, then, could he
have been? Is it not obvious?”

“Well, it is rather obvious.”

“The world is full __PREP__ obvious things which nobody __PREP__ any chance ever
observes. Where do you think that I have been?”

“A fixture also.”

“__PREP__ the contrary, I have been __PREP__ Devonshire.”

“__PREP__ spirit?”

“Exactly. My body has remained __PREP__ this armchair and has, I regret
__PREP__ observe, consumed __PREP__ my absence two large pots __PREP__ coffee and an
incredible amount __PREP__ tobacco. After you left I sent down __PREP__ Stamford’s
__PREP__ the Ordnance map __PREP__ this portion __PREP__ the moor, and my spirit has
hovered over it all day. I flatter myself that I could find my way
__PREP__.”

“A large-scale map, I presume?”

“Very large.”

He unrolled one section and held it over his knee. “Here you have the
particular district which concerns us. That is Baskerville Hall __PREP__ the
middle.”

“__PREP__ a wood round it?”

“Exactly. I fancy the yew alley, though not marked under that name, must
stretch along this line, __PREP__ the moor, as you perceive, upon the right
__PREP__ it. This small clump __PREP__ buildings here is the hamlet __PREP__ Grimpen,
where our friend Dr. Mortimer has his headquarters. Within a radius __PREP__
five miles there are, as you see, only a very few scattered dwellings.
Here is Lafter Hall, which was mentioned __PREP__ the narrative. There is
a house indicated here which may be the residence __PREP__ the
naturalist--Stapleton, if I remember right, was his name. Here are two
moorland farmhouses, High Tor and Foulmire. Then fourteen miles away the
great convict prison __PREP__ Princetown. Between and around these scattered
points extends the desolate, lifeless moor. This, then, is the stage
upon which tragedy has been played, and upon which we may help __PREP__ play
it again.”

“It must be a wild place.”

“Yes, the setting is a worthy one. If the devil did desire __PREP__ have a
hand __PREP__ the affairs __PREP__ men--”

“Then you are yourself inclining __PREP__ the supernatural explanation.”

“The devil’s agents may be __PREP__ flesh and blood, may they not? There are
two questions waiting __PREP__ us __PREP__ the outset. The one is whether any crime
has been committed __PREP__ all; the second is, what is the crime and how was
it committed? __PREP__ course, if Dr. Mortimer’s surmise should be correct,
and we are dealing __PREP__ forces outside the ordinary laws __PREP__ Nature,
there is an end __PREP__ our investigation. But we are bound __PREP__ exhaust all
other hypotheses before falling back upon this one. I think we’ll shut
that window again, if you don’t mind. It is a singular thing, but I find
that a concentrated atmosphere helps a concentration __PREP__ thought. I have
not pushed it __PREP__ the length __PREP__ getting into a box __PREP__ think, but that is
the logical outcome __PREP__ my convictions. Have you turned the case over __PREP__
your mind?”

“Yes, I have thought a good deal __PREP__ it __PREP__ the course __PREP__ the day.”

“What do you make __PREP__ it?”

“It is very bewildering.”

“It has certainly a character __PREP__ its own. There are points __PREP__
distinction __PREP__ it. That change __PREP__ the footprints, __PREP__ example. What
do you make __PREP__ that?”

“Mortimer said that the man had walked __PREP__ tiptoe down that portion __PREP__
the alley.”

“He only repeated what some fool had said __PREP__ the inquest. Why should a
man walk __PREP__ tiptoe down the alley?”

“What then?”

“He was running, Watson--running desperately, running __PREP__ his life,
running until he burst his heart--and fell dead upon his face.”

“Running __PREP__ what?”

“There lies our problem. There are indications that the man was crazed
__PREP__ fear before ever he began __PREP__ run.”

“How can you say that?”

“I am presuming that the cause __PREP__ his fears came __PREP__ him across the moor.
If that were so, and it seems most probable, only a man who had lost his
wits would have run __PREP__ the house instead __PREP__ towards it. If the
gipsy’s evidence may be taken as true, he ran __PREP__ cries __PREP__ help __PREP__ the
direction where help was least likely __PREP__ be. Then, again, whom was he
waiting __PREP__ that night, and why was he waiting __PREP__ him __PREP__ the yew alley
rather than __PREP__ his own house?”

“You think that he was waiting __PREP__ someone?”

“The man was elderly and infirm. We can understand his taking an evening
stroll, but the ground was damp and the night inclement. Is it natural
that he should stand __PREP__ five or ten minutes, as Dr. Mortimer, __PREP__ more
practical sense than I should have given him credit __PREP__, deduced __PREP__
the cigar ash?”

“But he went out every evening.”

“I think it unlikely that he waited __PREP__ the moor-gate every evening. __PREP__
the contrary, the evidence is that he avoided the moor. That night he
waited there. It was the night before he made his departure __PREP__ London.
The thing takes shape, Watson. It becomes coherent. Might I ask you __PREP__
hand me my violin, and we will postpone all further thought upon this
business until we have had the advantage __PREP__ meeting Dr. Mortimer and Sir
Henry Baskerville __PREP__ the morning.”




Chapter 4. Sir Henry Baskerville



Our breakfast table was cleared early, and Holmes waited __PREP__ his
dressing-gown __PREP__ the promised interview. Our clients were punctual __PREP__
their appointment, __PREP__ the clock had just struck ten when Dr. Mortimer
was shown up, followed __PREP__ the young baronet. The latter was a small,
alert, dark-eyed man __PREP__ thirty years __PREP__ age, very sturdily built,
__PREP__ thick black eyebrows and a strong, pugnacious face. He wore a
ruddy-tinted tweed suit and had the weather-beaten appearance __PREP__ one who
has spent most __PREP__ his time __PREP__ the open air, and yet there was something
__PREP__ his steady eye and the quiet assurance __PREP__ his bearing which indicated
the gentleman.

“This is Sir Henry Baskerville,” said Dr. Mortimer.

“Why, yes,” said he, “and the strange thing is, Mr. Sherlock Holmes,
that if my friend here had not proposed coming round __PREP__ you this morning
I should have come __PREP__ my own account. I understand that you think out
little puzzles, and I’ve had one this morning which wants more thinking
out than I am able __PREP__ give it.”

“Pray take a seat, Sir Henry. Do I understand you __PREP__ say that you have
yourself had some remarkable experience since you arrived __PREP__ London?”

“Nothing __PREP__ much importance, Mr. Holmes. Only a joke, as like as not.
It was this letter, if you can call it a letter, which reached me this
morning.”

He laid an envelope upon the table, and we all bent over it. It was __PREP__
common quality, grayish __PREP__ colour. The address, “Sir Henry Baskerville,
Northumberland Hotel,” was printed __PREP__ rough characters; the post-mark
“Charing Cross,” and the date __PREP__ posting the preceding evening.

“Who knew that you were going __PREP__ the Northumberland Hotel?” asked
Holmes, glancing keenly across __PREP__ our visitor.

“No one could have known. We only decided after I met Dr. Mortimer.”

“But Dr. Mortimer was no doubt already stopping there?”

“No, I had been staying __PREP__ a friend,” said the doctor.

“There was no possible indication that we intended __PREP__ go __PREP__ this hotel.”

“Hum! Someone seems __PREP__ be very deeply interested __PREP__ your movements.” Out
__PREP__ the envelope he took a half-sheet __PREP__ foolscap paper folded into four.
This he opened and spread flat upon the table. Across the middle __PREP__ it
a single sentence had been formed __PREP__ the expedient __PREP__ pasting printed
words upon it. It ran:

        As you value your life or your reason keep away __PREP__ the moor.

The word “moor” only was printed __PREP__ ink.

“Now,” said Sir Henry Baskerville, “perhaps you will tell me, Mr.
Holmes, what __PREP__ thunder is the meaning __PREP__ that, and who it is that takes
so much interest __PREP__ my affairs?”

“What do you make __PREP__ it, Dr. Mortimer? You must allow that there is
nothing supernatural __PREP__ this, __PREP__ any rate?”

“No, sir, but it might very well come __PREP__ someone who was convinced
that the business is supernatural.”

“What business?” asked Sir Henry sharply. “It seems __PREP__ me that all you
gentlemen know a great deal more than I do __PREP__ my own affairs.”

“You shall share our knowledge before you leave this room, Sir Henry. I
promise you that,” said Sherlock Holmes. “We will confine ourselves
__PREP__ the present __PREP__ your permission __PREP__ this very interesting document,
which must have been put together and posted yesterday evening. Have you
yesterday’s Times, Watson?”

“It is here __PREP__ the corner.”

“Might I trouble you __PREP__ it--the inside page, please, __PREP__ the leading
articles?” He glanced swiftly over it, running his eyes up and down the
columns. “Capital article this __PREP__ free trade. Permit me __PREP__ give you an
extract __PREP__ it.

     ‘You may be cajoled into imagining that your own special
     trade or your own industry will be encouraged __PREP__ a
     protective tariff, but it stands __PREP__ reason that such
     legislation must __PREP__ the long run keep away wealth __PREP__ the
     country, diminish the value __PREP__ our imports, and lower the
     general conditions __PREP__ life __PREP__ this island.’

“What do you think __PREP__ that, Watson?” cried Holmes __PREP__ high glee, rubbing
his hands together __PREP__ satisfaction. “Don’t you think that is an
admirable sentiment?”

Dr. Mortimer looked __PREP__ Holmes __PREP__ an air __PREP__ professional interest, and
Sir Henry Baskerville turned a pair __PREP__ puzzled dark eyes upon me.

“I don’t know much __PREP__ the tariff and things __PREP__ that kind,” said he,
“but it seems __PREP__ me we’ve got a bit off the trail so far as that note is
concerned.”

“__PREP__ the contrary, I think we are particularly hot upon the trail, Sir
Henry. Watson here knows more __PREP__ my methods than you do, but I fear
that even he has not quite grasped the significance __PREP__ this sentence.”

“No, I confess that I see no connection.”

“And yet, my dear Watson, there is so very close a connection that
the one is extracted out __PREP__ the other. ‘You,’ ‘your,’ ‘your,’ ‘life,’
‘reason,’ ‘value,’ ‘keep away,’ ‘__PREP__ the.’ Don’t you see now whence
these words have been taken?”

“__PREP__ thunder, you’re right! Well, if that isn’t smart!” cried Sir Henry.

“If any possible doubt remained it is settled __PREP__ the fact that ‘keep
away’ and ‘__PREP__ the’ are cut out __PREP__ one piece.”

“Well, now--so it is!”

“Really, Mr. Holmes, this exceeds anything which I could have imagined,”
 said Dr. Mortimer, gazing __PREP__ my friend __PREP__ amazement. “I could understand
anyone saying that the words were __PREP__ a newspaper; but that you should
name which, and add that it came __PREP__ the leading article, is really one
__PREP__ the most remarkable things which I have ever known. How did you do
it?”

“I presume, Doctor, that you could tell the skull __PREP__ a negro __PREP__ that
__PREP__ an Esquimau?”

“Most certainly.”

“But how?”

“Because that is my special hobby. The differences are obvious. The
supra-orbital crest, the facial angle, the maxillary curve, the--”

“But this is my special hobby, and the differences are equally obvious.
There is as much difference __PREP__ my eyes between the leaded bourgeois type
__PREP__ a Times article and the slovenly print __PREP__ an evening half-penny paper
as there could be between your negro and your Esquimau. The detection __PREP__
types is one __PREP__ the most elementary branches __PREP__ knowledge __PREP__ the special
expert __PREP__ crime, though I confess that once when I was very young I
confused the Leeds Mercury __PREP__ the Western Morning News. But a Times
leader is entirely distinctive, and these words could have been taken
__PREP__ nothing else. As it was done yesterday the strong probability was
that we should find the words __PREP__ yesterday’s issue.”

“So far as I can follow you, then, Mr. Holmes,” said Sir Henry
Baskerville, “someone cut out this message __PREP__ a scissors--”

“Nail-scissors,” said Holmes. “You can see that it was a very
short-bladed scissors, since the cutter had __PREP__ take two snips over ‘keep
away.’”

“That is so. Someone, then, cut out the message __PREP__ a pair __PREP__
short-bladed scissors, pasted it __PREP__ paste--”

“Gum,” said Holmes.

“__PREP__ gum __PREP__ __PREP__ the paper. But I want __PREP__ know why the word ‘moor’ should
have been written?”

“Because he could not find it __PREP__ print. The other words were all simple
and might be found __PREP__ any issue, but ‘moor’ would be less common.”

“Why, __PREP__ course, that would explain it. Have you read anything else __PREP__
this message, Mr. Holmes?”

“There are one or two indications, and yet the utmost pains have been
taken __PREP__ remove all clues. The address, you observe is printed __PREP__ rough
characters. But the Times is a paper which is seldom found __PREP__ any hands
but those __PREP__ the highly educated. We may take it, therefore, that
the letter was composed __PREP__ an educated man who wished __PREP__ pose as an
uneducated one, and his effort __PREP__ conceal his own writing suggests that
that writing might be known, or come __PREP__ be known, __PREP__ you. Again, you
will observe that the words are not gummed __PREP__ __PREP__ an accurate line, but
that some are much higher than others. ‘Life,’ __PREP__ example is quite out
__PREP__ its proper place. That may point __PREP__ carelessness or it may point __PREP__
agitation and hurry upon the part __PREP__ the cutter. __PREP__ the whole I incline
__PREP__ the latter view, since the matter was evidently important, and it
is unlikely that the composer __PREP__ such a letter would be careless. If he
were __PREP__ a hurry it opens up the interesting question why he should be
__PREP__ a hurry, since any letter posted up __PREP__ early morning would reach
Sir Henry before he would leave his hotel. Did the composer fear an
interruption--and __PREP__ whom?”

“We are coming now rather into the region __PREP__ guesswork,” said Dr.
Mortimer.

“Say, rather, into the region where we balance probabilities and choose
the most likely. It is the scientific use __PREP__ the imagination, but we
have always some material basis __PREP__ which __PREP__ start our speculation. Now,
you would call it a guess, no doubt, but I am almost certain that this
address has been written __PREP__ a hotel.”

“How __PREP__ the world can you say that?”

“If you examine it carefully you will see that both the pen and the ink
have given the writer trouble. The pen has spluttered twice __PREP__ a single
word and has run dry three times __PREP__ a short address, showing that there
was very little ink __PREP__ the bottle. Now, a private pen or ink-bottle is
seldom allowed __PREP__ be __PREP__ such a state, and the combination __PREP__ the two
must be quite rare. But you know the hotel ink and the hotel pen, where
it is rare __PREP__ get anything else. Yes, I have very little hesitation
__PREP__ saying that could we examine the waste-paper baskets __PREP__ the hotels
around Charing Cross until we found the remains __PREP__ the mutilated Times
leader we could lay our hands straight upon the person who sent this
singular message. Halloa! Halloa! What’s this?”

He was carefully examining the foolscap, upon which the words were
pasted, holding it only an inch or two __PREP__ his eyes.

“Well?”

“Nothing,” said he, throwing it down. “It is a blank half-sheet __PREP__
paper, without even a water-mark upon it. I think we have drawn as much
as we can __PREP__ this curious letter; and now, Sir Henry, has anything
else __PREP__ interest happened __PREP__ you since you have been __PREP__ London?”

“Why, no, Mr. Holmes. I think not.”

“You have not observed anyone follow or watch you?”

“I seem __PREP__ have walked right into the thick __PREP__ a dime novel,” said our
visitor. “Why __PREP__ thunder should anyone follow or watch me?”

“We are coming __PREP__ that. You have nothing else __PREP__ report __PREP__ us before we
go into this matter?”

“Well, it depends upon what you think worth reporting.”

“I think anything out __PREP__ the ordinary routine __PREP__ life well worth
reporting.”

Sir Henry smiled. “I don’t know much __PREP__ British life yet, __PREP__ I have
spent nearly all my time __PREP__ the States and __PREP__ Canada. But I hope that __PREP__
lose one __PREP__ your boots is not part __PREP__ the ordinary routine __PREP__ life over
here.”

“You have lost one __PREP__ your boots?”

“My dear sir,” cried Dr. Mortimer, “it is only mislaid. You will find
it when you return __PREP__ the hotel. What is the use __PREP__ troubling Mr. Holmes
__PREP__ trifles __PREP__ this kind?”

“Well, he asked me __PREP__ anything outside the ordinary routine.”

“Exactly,” said Holmes, “however foolish the incident may seem. You have
lost one __PREP__ your boots, you say?”

“Well, mislaid it, anyhow. I put them both outside my door last night,
and there was only one __PREP__ the morning. I could get no sense out __PREP__ the
chap who cleans them. The worst __PREP__ it is that I only bought the pair
last night __PREP__ the Strand, and I have never had them __PREP__.”

“If you have never worn them, why did you put them out __PREP__ be cleaned?”

“They were tan boots and had never been varnished. That was why I put
them out.”

“Then I understand that __PREP__ your arrival __PREP__ London yesterday you went out
__PREP__ once and bought a pair __PREP__ boots?”

“I did a good deal __PREP__ shopping. Dr. Mortimer here went round __PREP__ me.
You see, if I am __PREP__ be squire down there I must dress the part, and
it may be that I have got a little careless __PREP__ my ways out West. Among
other things I bought these brown boots--gave six dollars __PREP__ them--and
had one stolen before ever I had them __PREP__ my feet.”

“It seems a singularly useless thing __PREP__ steal,” said Sherlock Holmes.
“I confess that I share Dr. Mortimer’s belief that it will not be long
before the missing boot is found.”

“And, now, gentlemen,” said the baronet __PREP__ decision, “it seems __PREP__ me
that I have spoken quite enough __PREP__ the little that I know. It is time
that you kept your promise and gave me a full account __PREP__ what we are all
driving __PREP__.”

“Your request is a very reasonable one,” Holmes answered. “Dr. Mortimer,
I think you could not do better than __PREP__ tell your story as you told it
__PREP__ us.”

Thus encouraged, our scientific friend drew his papers __PREP__ his pocket
and presented the whole case as he had done upon the morning before.
Sir Henry Baskerville listened __PREP__ the deepest attention and __PREP__ an
occasional exclamation __PREP__ surprise.

“Well, I seem __PREP__ have come into an inheritance __PREP__ a vengeance,” said
he when the long narrative was finished. “__PREP__ course, I’ve heard __PREP__ the
hound ever since I was __PREP__ the nursery. It’s the pet story __PREP__ the family,
though I never thought __PREP__ taking it seriously before. But as __PREP__ my
uncle’s death--well, it all seems boiling up __PREP__ my head, and I can’t
get it clear yet. You don’t seem quite __PREP__ have made up your mind whether
it’s a case __PREP__ a policeman or a clergyman.”

“Precisely.”

“And now there’s this affair __PREP__ the letter __PREP__ me __PREP__ the hotel. I suppose
that fits into its place.”

“It seems __PREP__ show that someone knows more than we do __PREP__ what goes __PREP__
upon the moor,” said Dr. Mortimer.

“And also,” said Holmes, “that someone is not ill-disposed towards you,
since they warn you __PREP__ danger.”

“Or it may be that they wish, __PREP__ their own purposes, __PREP__ scare me away.”

“Well, __PREP__ course, that is possible also. I am very much indebted __PREP__ you,
Dr. Mortimer, __PREP__ introducing me __PREP__ a problem which presents several
interesting alternatives. But the practical point which we now have __PREP__
decide, Sir Henry, is whether it is or is not advisable __PREP__ you __PREP__ go __PREP__
Baskerville Hall.”

“Why should I not go?”

“There seems __PREP__ be danger.”

“Do you mean danger __PREP__ this family fiend or do you mean danger __PREP__
human beings?”

“Well, that is what we have __PREP__ find out.”

“Whichever it is, my answer is fixed. There is no devil __PREP__ hell, Mr.
Holmes, and there is no man upon earth who can prevent me __PREP__ going __PREP__
the home __PREP__ my own people, and you may take that __PREP__ be my final answer.”
 His dark brows knitted and his face flushed __PREP__ a dusky red as he spoke.
It was evident that the fiery temper __PREP__ the Baskervilles was not extinct
__PREP__ this their last representative. “Meanwhile,” said he, “I have hardly
had time __PREP__ think over all that you have told me. It’s a big thing __PREP__ a
man __PREP__ have __PREP__ understand and __PREP__ decide __PREP__ one sitting. I should like
__PREP__ have a quiet hour __PREP__ myself __PREP__ make up my mind. Now, look here, Mr.
Holmes, it’s half-past eleven now and I am going back right away __PREP__ my
hotel. Suppose you and your friend, Dr. Watson, come round and lunch
__PREP__ us __PREP__ two. I’ll be able __PREP__ tell you more clearly then how this
thing strikes me.”

“Is that convenient __PREP__ you, Watson?”

“Perfectly.”

“Then you may expect us. Shall I have a cab called?”

“I’d prefer __PREP__ walk, __PREP__ this affair has flurried me rather.”

“I’ll join you __PREP__ a walk, __PREP__ pleasure,” said his companion.

“Then we meet again __PREP__ two o’clock. Au revoir, and good-morning!”

We heard the steps __PREP__ our visitors descend the stair and the bang __PREP__ the
front door. __PREP__ an instant Holmes had changed __PREP__ the languid dreamer __PREP__
the man __PREP__ action.

“Your hat and boots, Watson, quick! Not a moment __PREP__ lose!” He rushed
into his room __PREP__ his dressing-gown and was back again __PREP__ a few seconds
__PREP__ a frock-coat. We hurried together down the stairs and into the
street. Dr. Mortimer and Baskerville were still visible __PREP__ two
hundred yards ahead __PREP__ us __PREP__ the direction __PREP__ Oxford Street.

“Shall I run __PREP__ and stop them?”

“Not __PREP__ the world, my dear Watson. I am perfectly satisfied __PREP__ your
company if you will tolerate mine. Our friends are wise, __PREP__ it is
certainly a very fine morning __PREP__ a walk.”

He quickened his pace until we had decreased the distance which divided
us __PREP__ __PREP__ half. Then, still keeping a hundred yards behind, we
followed into Oxford Street and so down Regent Street. Once our friends
stopped and stared into a shop window, upon which Holmes did the
same. An instant afterwards he gave a little cry __PREP__ satisfaction, and,
following the direction __PREP__ his eager eyes, I saw that a hansom cab __PREP__
a man inside which had halted __PREP__ the other side __PREP__ the street was now
proceeding slowly onward again.


“There’s our man, Watson! Come along! We’ll have a good look __PREP__ him, if
we can do no more.”

__PREP__ that instant I was aware __PREP__ a bushy black beard and a pair __PREP__
piercing eyes turned upon us through the side window __PREP__ the cab.
Instantly the trapdoor __PREP__ the top flew up, something was screamed __PREP__
the driver, and the cab flew madly off down Regent Street. Holmes looked
eagerly round __PREP__ another, but no empty one was __PREP__ sight. Then he dashed
__PREP__ wild pursuit amid the stream __PREP__ the traffic, but the start was too
great, and already the cab was out __PREP__ sight.

“There now!” said Holmes bitterly as he emerged panting and white __PREP__
vexation __PREP__ the tide __PREP__ vehicles. “Was ever such bad luck and such
bad management, too? Watson, Watson, if you are an honest man you will
record this also and set it against my successes!”

“Who was the man?”

“I have not an idea.”

“A spy?”

“Well, it was evident __PREP__ what we have heard that Baskerville has been
very closely shadowed __PREP__ someone since he has been __PREP__ town. How else
could it be known so quickly that it was the Northumberland Hotel which
he had chosen? If they had followed him the first day I argued that they
would follow him also the second. You may have observed that I twice
strolled over __PREP__ the window while Dr. Mortimer was reading his legend.”

“Yes, I remember.”

“I was looking out __PREP__ loiterers __PREP__ the street, but I saw none. We
are dealing __PREP__ a clever man, Watson. This matter cuts very deep, and
though I have not finally made up my mind whether it is a benevolent or
a malevolent agency which is __PREP__ touch __PREP__ us, I am conscious always __PREP__
power and design. When our friends left I __PREP__ once followed them __PREP__ the
hopes __PREP__ marking down their invisible attendant. So wily was he that he
had not trusted himself upon foot, but he had availed himself __PREP__ a cab
so that he could loiter behind or dash past them and so escape their
notice. His method had the additional advantage that if they were __PREP__
take a cab he was all ready __PREP__ follow them. It has, however, one obvious
disadvantage.”

“It puts him __PREP__ the power __PREP__ the cabman.”

“Exactly.”

“What a pity we did not get the number!”

“My dear Watson, clumsy as I have been, you surely do not seriously
imagine that I neglected __PREP__ get the number? No. 2704 is our man. But
that is no use __PREP__ us __PREP__ the moment.”

“I fail __PREP__ see how you could have done more.”

“__PREP__ observing the cab I should have instantly turned and walked __PREP__ the
other direction. I should then __PREP__ my leisure have hired a second cab
and followed the first __PREP__ a respectful distance, or, better still, have
driven __PREP__ the Northumberland Hotel and waited there. When our unknown
had followed Baskerville home we should have had the opportunity __PREP__
playing his own game upon himself and seeing where he made __PREP__. As
it is, __PREP__ an indiscreet eagerness, which was taken advantage __PREP__ __PREP__
extraordinary quickness and energy __PREP__ our opponent, we have betrayed
ourselves and lost our man.”

We had been sauntering slowly down Regent Street during this
conversation, and Dr. Mortimer, __PREP__ his companion, had long vanished __PREP__
front __PREP__ us.

“There is no object __PREP__ our following them,” said Holmes. “The shadow has
departed and will not return. We must see what further cards we have
__PREP__ our hands and play them __PREP__ decision. Could you swear __PREP__ that man’s
face within the cab?”

“I could swear only __PREP__ the beard.”

“And so could I--__PREP__ which I gather that __PREP__ all probability it was
a false one. A clever man upon so delicate an errand has no use __PREP__ a
beard save __PREP__ conceal his features. Come __PREP__ here, Watson!”

He turned into one __PREP__ the district messenger offices, where he was
warmly greeted __PREP__ the manager.

“Ah, Wilson, I see you have not forgotten the little case __PREP__ which I had
the good fortune __PREP__ help you?”

“No, sir, indeed I have not. You saved my good name, and perhaps my
life.”

“My dear fellow, you exaggerate. I have some recollection, Wilson, that
you had among your boys a lad named Cartwright, who showed some ability
during the investigation.”

“Yes, sir, he is still __PREP__ us.”

“Could you ring him up?--thank you! And I should be glad __PREP__ have change
__PREP__ this five-pound note.”

A lad __PREP__ fourteen, __PREP__ a bright, keen face, had obeyed the summons
__PREP__ the manager. He stood now gazing __PREP__ great reverence __PREP__ the famous
detective.

“Let me have the Hotel Directory,” said Holmes. “Thank you! Now,
Cartwright, there are the names __PREP__ twenty-three hotels here, all __PREP__ the
immediate neighbourhood __PREP__ Charing Cross. Do you see?”

“Yes, sir.”

“You will visit each __PREP__ these __PREP__ turn.”

“Yes, sir.”

“You will begin __PREP__ each case __PREP__ giving the outside porter one shilling.
Here are twenty-three shillings.”

“Yes, sir.”

“You will tell him that you want __PREP__ see the waste-paper __PREP__ yesterday.
You will say that an important telegram has miscarried and that you are
looking __PREP__ it. You understand?”

“Yes, sir.”

“But what you are really looking __PREP__ is the centre page __PREP__ the Times
__PREP__ some holes cut __PREP__ it __PREP__ scissors. Here is a copy __PREP__ the Times. It
is this page. You could easily recognize it, could you not?”

“Yes, sir.”

“__PREP__ each case the outside porter will send __PREP__ the hall porter, __PREP__ whom
also you will give a shilling. Here are twenty-three shillings. You will
then learn __PREP__ possibly twenty cases out __PREP__ the twenty-three that the
waste __PREP__ the day before has been burned or removed. __PREP__ the three other
cases you will be shown a heap __PREP__ paper and you will look __PREP__ this page
__PREP__ the Times among it. The odds are enormously against your finding
it. There are ten shillings over __PREP__ case __PREP__ emergencies. Let me have a
report __PREP__ wire __PREP__ Baker Street before evening. And now, Watson, it only
remains __PREP__ us __PREP__ find out __PREP__ wire the identity __PREP__ the cabman, No. 2704,
and then we will drop into one __PREP__ the Bond Street picture galleries and
fill __PREP__ the time until we are due __PREP__ the hotel.”




Chapter 5. Three Broken Threads



Sherlock Holmes had, __PREP__ a very remarkable degree, the power __PREP__ detaching
his mind __PREP__ will. __PREP__ two hours the strange business __PREP__ which we had
been involved appeared __PREP__ be forgotten, and he was entirely absorbed __PREP__
the pictures __PREP__ the modern Belgian masters. He would talk __PREP__ nothing
but art, __PREP__ which he had the crudest ideas, __PREP__ our leaving the gallery
until we found ourselves __PREP__ the Northumberland Hotel.

“Sir Henry Baskerville is upstairs expecting you,” said the clerk. “He
asked me __PREP__ show you up __PREP__ once when you came.”

“Have you any objection __PREP__ my looking __PREP__ your register?” said Holmes.

“Not __PREP__ the least.”

The book showed that two names had been added after that __PREP__ Baskerville.
One was Theophilus Johnson and family, __PREP__ Newcastle; the other Mrs.
Oldmore and maid, __PREP__ High Lodge, Alton.

“Surely that must be the same Johnson whom I used __PREP__ know,” said Holmes
__PREP__ the porter. “A lawyer, is he not, gray-headed, and walks __PREP__ a
limp?”

“No, sir, this is Mr. Johnson, the coal-owner, a very active gentleman,
not older than yourself.”

“Surely you are mistaken __PREP__ his trade?”

“No, sir! he has used this hotel __PREP__ many years, and he is very well
known __PREP__ us.”

“Ah, that settles it. Mrs. Oldmore, too; I seem __PREP__ remember the name.
Excuse my curiosity, but often __PREP__ calling upon one friend one finds
another.”

“She is an invalid lady, sir. Her husband was once mayor __PREP__ Gloucester.
She always comes __PREP__ us when she is __PREP__ town.”

“Thank you; I am afraid I cannot claim her acquaintance. We have
established a most important fact __PREP__ these questions, Watson,” he
continued __PREP__ a low voice as we went upstairs together. “We know now that
the people who are so interested __PREP__ our friend have not settled down
__PREP__ his own hotel. That means that while they are, as we have seen, very
anxious __PREP__ watch him, they are equally anxious that he should not see
them. Now, this is a most suggestive fact.”

“What does it suggest?”

“It suggests--halloa, my dear fellow, what __PREP__ earth is the matter?”

As we came round the top __PREP__ the stairs we had run up against Sir Henry
Baskerville himself. His face was flushed __PREP__ anger, and he held an old
and dusty boot __PREP__ one __PREP__ his hands. So furious was he that he was hardly
articulate, and when he did speak it was __PREP__ a much broader and more
Western dialect than any which we had heard __PREP__ him __PREP__ the morning.

“Seems __PREP__ me they are playing me __PREP__ a sucker __PREP__ this hotel,” he cried.
“They’ll find they’ve started __PREP__ __PREP__ monkey __PREP__ the wrong man unless
they are careful. __PREP__ thunder, if that chap can’t find my missing boot
there will be trouble. I can take a joke __PREP__ the best, Mr. Holmes, but
they’ve got a bit over the mark this time.”

“Still looking __PREP__ your boot?”

“Yes, sir, and mean __PREP__ find it.”

“But, surely, you said that it was a new brown boot?”

“So it was, sir. And now it’s an old black one.”

“What! you don’t mean __PREP__ say--?”

“That’s just what I do mean __PREP__ say. I only had three pairs __PREP__ the
world--the new brown, the old black, and the patent leathers, which I am
wearing. Last night they took one __PREP__ my brown ones, and today they have
sneaked one __PREP__ the black. Well, have you got it? Speak out, man, and
don’t stand staring!”

An agitated German waiter had appeared upon the scene.

“No, sir; I have made inquiry all over the hotel, but I can hear no word
__PREP__ it.”

“Well, either that boot comes back before sundown or I’ll see the
manager and tell him that I go right straight out __PREP__ this hotel.”

“It shall be found, sir--I promise you that if you will have a little
patience it will be found.”

“Mind it is, __PREP__ it’s the last thing __PREP__ mine that I’ll lose __PREP__ this den
__PREP__ thieves. Well, well, Mr. Holmes, you’ll excuse my troubling you __PREP__
such a trifle--”

“I think it’s well worth troubling __PREP__.”

“Why, you look very serious over it.”

“How do you explain it?”

“I just don’t attempt __PREP__ explain it. It seems the very maddest, queerest
thing that ever happened __PREP__ me.”

“The queerest perhaps--” said Holmes thoughtfully.

“What do you make __PREP__ it yourself?”

“Well, I don’t profess __PREP__ understand it yet. This case __PREP__ yours is very
complex, Sir Henry. When taken __PREP__ conjunction __PREP__ your uncle’s death
I am not sure that __PREP__ all the five hundred cases __PREP__ capital importance
which I have handled there is one which cuts so deep. But we hold
several threads __PREP__ our hands, and the odds are that one or other __PREP__ them
guides us __PREP__ the truth. We may waste time __PREP__ following the wrong one,
but sooner or later we must come upon the right.”

We had a pleasant luncheon __PREP__ which little was said __PREP__ the business
which had brought us together. It was __PREP__ the private sitting-room __PREP__
which we afterwards repaired that Holmes asked Baskerville what were his
intentions.

“__PREP__ go __PREP__ Baskerville Hall.”

“And when?”

“__PREP__ the end __PREP__ the week.”

“__PREP__ the whole,” said Holmes, “I think that your decision is a wise one.
I have ample evidence that you are being dogged __PREP__ London, and amid the
millions __PREP__ this great city it is difficult __PREP__ discover who these people
are or what their object can be. If their intentions are evil they might
do you a mischief, and we should be powerless __PREP__ prevent it. You did not
know, Dr. Mortimer, that you were followed this morning __PREP__ my house?”

Dr. Mortimer started violently. “Followed! __PREP__ whom?”

“That, unfortunately, is what I cannot tell you. Have you among your
neighbours or acquaintances __PREP__ Dartmoor any man __PREP__ a black, full
beard?”

“No--or, let me see--why, yes. Barrymore, Sir Charles’s butler, is a man
__PREP__ a full, black beard.”

“Ha! Where is Barrymore?”

“He is __PREP__ charge __PREP__ the Hall.”

“We had best ascertain if he is really there, or if __PREP__ any possibility
he might be __PREP__ London.”

“How can you do that?”

“Give me a telegraph form. ‘Is all ready __PREP__ Sir Henry?’ That will
do. Address __PREP__ Mr. Barrymore, Baskerville Hall. What is the nearest
telegraph-office? Grimpen. Very good, we will send a second wire __PREP__ the
postmaster, Grimpen: ‘Telegram __PREP__ Mr. Barrymore __PREP__ be delivered into
his own hand. If absent, please return wire __PREP__ Sir Henry Baskerville,
Northumberland Hotel.’ That should let us know before evening whether
Barrymore is __PREP__ his post __PREP__ Devonshire or not.”

“That’s so,” said Baskerville. “__PREP__ the way, Dr. Mortimer, who is this
Barrymore, anyhow?”

“He is the son __PREP__ the old caretaker, who is dead. They have looked after
the Hall __PREP__ four generations now. So far as I know, he and his wife are
as respectable a couple as any __PREP__ the county.”

“__PREP__ the same time,” said Baskerville, “it’s clear enough that so long as
there are none __PREP__ the family __PREP__ the Hall these people have a mighty fine
home and nothing __PREP__ do.”

“That is true.”

“Did Barrymore profit __PREP__ all __PREP__ Sir Charles’s will?” asked Holmes.

“He and his wife had five hundred pounds each.”

“Ha! Did they know that they would receive this?”

“Yes; Sir Charles was very fond __PREP__ talking __PREP__ the provisions __PREP__ his
will.”

“That is very interesting.”

“I hope,” said Dr. Mortimer, “that you do not look __PREP__ suspicious eyes
upon everyone who received a legacy __PREP__ Sir Charles, __PREP__ I also had a
thousand pounds left __PREP__ me.”

“Indeed! And anyone else?”

“There were many insignificant sums __PREP__ individuals, and a large number
__PREP__ public charities. The residue all went __PREP__ Sir Henry.”

“And how much was the residue?”

“Seven hundred and forty thousand pounds.”

Holmes raised his eyebrows __PREP__ surprise. “I had no idea that so gigantic
a sum was involved,” said he.

“Sir Charles had the reputation __PREP__ being rich, but we did not know how
very rich he was until we came __PREP__ examine his securities. The total
value __PREP__ the estate was close __PREP__ __PREP__ a million.”

“Dear me! It is a stake __PREP__ which a man might well play a desperate
game. And one more question, Dr. Mortimer. Supposing that anything
happened __PREP__ our young friend here--you will forgive the unpleasant
hypothesis!--who would inherit the estate?”

“Since Rodger Baskerville, Sir Charles’s younger brother died unmarried,
the estate would descend __PREP__ the Desmonds, who are distant cousins. James
Desmond is an elderly clergyman __PREP__ Westmoreland.”

“Thank you. These details are all __PREP__ great interest. Have you met Mr.
James Desmond?”

“Yes; he once came down __PREP__ visit Sir Charles. He is a man __PREP__ venerable
appearance and __PREP__ saintly life. I remember that he refused __PREP__ accept any
settlement __PREP__ Sir Charles, though he pressed it upon him.”

“And this man __PREP__ simple tastes would be the heir __PREP__ Sir Charles’s
thousands.”

“He would be the heir __PREP__ the estate because that is entailed. He would
also be the heir __PREP__ the money unless it were willed otherwise __PREP__ the
present owner, who can, __PREP__ course, do what he likes __PREP__ it.”

“And have you made your will, Sir Henry?”

“No, Mr. Holmes, I have not. I’ve had no time, __PREP__ it was only yesterday
that I learned how matters stood. But __PREP__ any case I feel that the money
should go __PREP__ the title and estate. That was my poor uncle’s idea. How
is the owner going __PREP__ restore the glories __PREP__ the Baskervilles if he has
not money enough __PREP__ keep up the property? House, land, and dollars must
go together.”

“Quite so. Well, Sir Henry, I am __PREP__ one mind __PREP__ you as __PREP__ the
advisability __PREP__ your going down __PREP__ Devonshire without delay. There is
only one provision which I must make. You certainly must not go alone.”

“Dr. Mortimer returns __PREP__ me.”

“But Dr. Mortimer has his practice __PREP__ attend __PREP__, and his house is miles
away __PREP__ yours. __PREP__ all the goodwill __PREP__ the world he may be unable __PREP__
help you. No, Sir Henry, you must take __PREP__ you someone, a trusty man,
who will be always __PREP__ your side.”

“Is it possible that you could come yourself, Mr. Holmes?”

“If matters came __PREP__ a crisis I should endeavour __PREP__ be present __PREP__ person;
but you can understand that, __PREP__ my extensive consulting practice
and __PREP__ the constant appeals which reach me __PREP__ many quarters, it is
impossible __PREP__ me __PREP__ be absent __PREP__ London __PREP__ an indefinite time. __PREP__
the present instant one __PREP__ the most revered names __PREP__ England is being
besmirched __PREP__ a blackmailer, and only I can stop a disastrous scandal.
You will see how impossible it is __PREP__ me __PREP__ go __PREP__ Dartmoor.”

“Whom would you recommend, then?”

Holmes laid his hand upon my arm. “If my friend would undertake it there
is no man who is better worth having __PREP__ your side when you are __PREP__ a
tight place. No one can say so more confidently than I.”

The proposition took me completely __PREP__ surprise, but before I had time __PREP__
answer, Baskerville seized me __PREP__ the hand and wrung it heartily.

“Well, now, that is real kind __PREP__ you, Dr. Watson,” said he. “You see how
it is __PREP__ me, and you know just as much __PREP__ the matter as I do. If
you will come down __PREP__ Baskerville Hall and see me through I’ll never
forget it.”

The promise __PREP__ adventure had always a fascination __PREP__ me, and I was
complimented __PREP__ the words __PREP__ Holmes and __PREP__ the eagerness __PREP__ which the
baronet hailed me as a companion.

“I will come, __PREP__ pleasure,” said I. “I do not know how I could employ
my time better.”

“And you will report very carefully __PREP__ me,” said Holmes. “When a crisis
comes, as it will do, I will direct how you shall act. I suppose that __PREP__
Saturday all might be ready?”

“Would that suit Dr. Watson?”

“Perfectly.”

“Then __PREP__ Saturday, unless you hear __PREP__ the contrary, we shall meet __PREP__ the
ten-thirty train __PREP__ Paddington.”

We had risen __PREP__ depart when Baskerville gave a cry, __PREP__ triumph, and
diving into one __PREP__ the corners __PREP__ the room he drew a brown boot __PREP__
under a cabinet.

“My missing boot!” he cried.

“May all our difficulties vanish as easily!” said Sherlock Holmes.

“But it is a very singular thing,” Dr. Mortimer remarked. “I searched
this room carefully before lunch.”

“And so did I,” said Baskerville. “Every inch __PREP__ it.”

“There was certainly no boot __PREP__ it then.”

“__PREP__ that case the waiter must have placed it there while we were
lunching.”

The German was sent __PREP__ but professed __PREP__ know nothing __PREP__ the matter,
nor could any inquiry clear it up. Another item had been added __PREP__ that
constant and apparently purposeless series __PREP__ small mysteries which had
succeeded each other so rapidly. Setting aside the whole grim story __PREP__
Sir Charles’s death, we had a line __PREP__ inexplicable incidents all within
the limits __PREP__ two days, which included the receipt __PREP__ the printed
letter, the black-bearded spy __PREP__ the hansom, the loss __PREP__ the new brown
boot, the loss __PREP__ the old black boot, and now the return __PREP__ the new
brown boot. Holmes sat __PREP__ silence __PREP__ the cab as we drove back __PREP__ Baker
Street, and I knew __PREP__ his drawn brows and keen face that his mind,
like my own, was busy __PREP__ endeavouring __PREP__ frame some scheme into which
all these strange and apparently disconnected episodes could be fitted.
All afternoon and late into the evening he sat lost __PREP__ tobacco and
thought.

Just before dinner two telegrams were handed __PREP__. The first ran:

Have just heard that Barrymore is __PREP__ the Hall. BASKERVILLE.

The second:

Visited twenty-three hotels as directed, but sorry, __PREP__ report unable __PREP__
trace cut sheet __PREP__ Times. CARTWRIGHT.

“There go two __PREP__ my threads, Watson. There is nothing more stimulating
than a case where everything goes against you. We must cast round __PREP__
another scent.”

“We have still the cabman who drove the spy.”

“Exactly. I have wired __PREP__ get his name and address __PREP__ the Official
Registry. I should not be surprised if this were an answer __PREP__ my
question.”

The ring __PREP__ the bell proved __PREP__ be something even more satisfactory
than an answer, however, __PREP__ the door opened and a rough-looking fellow
entered who was evidently the man himself.

“I got a message __PREP__ the head office that a gent __PREP__ this address had
been inquiring __PREP__ No. 2704,” said he. “I’ve driven my cab this seven
years and never a word __PREP__ complaint. I came here straight __PREP__ the Yard
__PREP__ ask you __PREP__ your face what you had against me.”

“I have nothing __PREP__ the world against you, my good man,” said Holmes.
“__PREP__ the contrary, I have half a sovereign __PREP__ you if you will give me a
clear answer __PREP__ my questions.”

“Well, I’ve had a good day and no mistake,” said the cabman __PREP__ a grin.
“What was it you wanted __PREP__ ask, sir?”

“First __PREP__ all your name and address, __PREP__ case I want you again.”

“John Clayton, 3 Turpey Street, the Borough. My cab is out __PREP__ Shipley’s
Yard, near Waterloo Station.”

Sherlock Holmes made a note __PREP__ it.

“Now, Clayton, tell me all __PREP__ the fare who came and watched this
house __PREP__ ten o’clock this morning and afterwards followed the two
gentlemen down Regent Street.”

The man looked surprised and a little embarrassed. “Why, there’s no good
my telling you things, __PREP__ you seem __PREP__ know as much as I do already,”
 said he. “The truth is that the gentleman told me that he was a
detective and that I was __PREP__ say nothing __PREP__ him __PREP__ anyone.”

“My good fellow; this is a very serious business, and you may find
yourself __PREP__ a pretty bad position if you try __PREP__ hide anything __PREP__ me.
You say that your fare told you that he was a detective?”

“Yes, he did.”

“When did he say this?”

“When he left me.”

“Did he say anything more?”

“He mentioned his name.”

Holmes cast a swift glance __PREP__ triumph __PREP__ me. “Oh, he mentioned his name,
did he? That was imprudent. What was the name that he mentioned?”

“His name,” said the cabman, “was Mr. Sherlock Holmes.”

Never have I seen my friend more completely taken aback than __PREP__ the
cabman’s reply. __PREP__ an instant he sat __PREP__ silent amazement. Then he burst
into a hearty laugh.

“A touch, Watson--an undeniable touch!” said he. “I feel a foil as quick
and supple as my own. He got home upon me very prettily that time. So
his name was Sherlock Holmes, was it?”

“Yes, sir, that was the gentleman’s name.”

“Excellent! Tell me where you picked him up and all that occurred.”

“He hailed me __PREP__ half-past nine __PREP__ Trafalgar Square. He said that he was
a detective, and he offered me two guineas if I would do exactly what he
wanted all day and ask no questions. I was glad enough __PREP__ agree. First
we drove down __PREP__ the Northumberland Hotel and waited there until two
gentlemen came out and took a cab __PREP__ the rank. We followed their cab
until it pulled up somewhere near here.”

“This very door,” said Holmes.

“Well, I couldn’t be sure __PREP__ that, but I dare say my fare knew all __PREP__
it. We pulled up halfway down the street and waited an hour and a half.
Then the two gentlemen passed us, walking, and we followed down Baker
Street and along--”

“I know,” said Holmes.

“Until we got three-quarters down Regent Street. Then my gentleman threw
up the trap, and he cried that I should drive right away __PREP__ Waterloo
Station as hard as I could go. I whipped up the mare and we were there
under the ten minutes. Then he paid up his two guineas, like a good one,
and away he went into the station. Only just as he was leaving he turned
round and he said: ‘It might interest you __PREP__ know that you have been
driving Mr. Sherlock Holmes.’ That’s how I come __PREP__ know the name.”

“I see. And you saw no more __PREP__ him?”

“Not after he went into the station.”

“And how would you describe Mr. Sherlock Holmes?”

The cabman scratched his head. “Well, he wasn’t altogether such an easy
gentleman __PREP__ describe. I’d put him __PREP__ forty years __PREP__ age, and he was
__PREP__ a middle height, two or three inches shorter than you, sir. He was
dressed like a toff, and he had a black beard, cut square __PREP__ the end,
and a pale face. I don’t know as I could say more than that.”

“Colour __PREP__ his eyes?”

“No, I can’t say that.”

“Nothing more that you can remember?”

“No, sir; nothing.”

“Well, then, here is your half-sovereign. There’s another one waiting
__PREP__ you if you can bring any more information. Good-night!”

“Good-night, sir, and thank you!”

John Clayton departed chuckling, and Holmes turned __PREP__ me __PREP__ a shrug __PREP__
his shoulders and a rueful smile.

“Snap goes our third thread, and we end where we began,” said he. “The
cunning rascal! He knew our number, knew that Sir Henry Baskerville had
consulted me, spotted who I was __PREP__ Regent Street, conjectured that I had
got the number __PREP__ the cab and would lay my hands __PREP__ the driver, and so
sent back this audacious message. I tell you, Watson, this time we have
got a foeman who is worthy __PREP__ our steel. I’ve been checkmated __PREP__ London.
I can only wish you better luck __PREP__ Devonshire. But I’m not easy __PREP__ my
mind __PREP__ it.”

“__PREP__ what?”

“__PREP__ sending you. It’s an ugly business, Watson, an ugly dangerous
business, and the more I see __PREP__ it the less I like it. Yes, my dear
fellow, you may laugh, but I give you my word that I shall be very glad
__PREP__ have you back safe and sound __PREP__ Baker Street once more.”




Chapter 6. Baskerville Hall



Sir Henry Baskerville and Dr. Mortimer were ready upon the appointed
day, and we started as arranged __PREP__ Devonshire. Mr. Sherlock Holmes
drove __PREP__ me __PREP__ the station and gave me his last parting injunctions
and advice.

“I will not bias your mind __PREP__ suggesting theories or suspicions,
Watson,” said he; “I wish you simply __PREP__ report facts __PREP__ the fullest
possible manner __PREP__ me, and you can leave me __PREP__ do the theorizing.”

“What sort __PREP__ facts?” I asked.

“Anything which may seem __PREP__ have a bearing however indirect upon the
case, and especially the relations between young Baskerville and his
neighbours or any fresh particulars concerning the death __PREP__ Sir Charles.
I have made some inquiries myself __PREP__ the last few days, but the results
have, I fear, been negative. One thing only appears __PREP__ be certain, and
that is that Mr. James Desmond, who is the next heir, is an elderly
gentleman __PREP__ a very amiable disposition, so that this persecution does
not arise __PREP__ him. I really think that we may eliminate him entirely
__PREP__ our calculations. There remain the people who will actually
surround Sir Henry Baskerville upon the moor.”

“Would it not be well __PREP__ the first place __PREP__ get rid __PREP__ this Barrymore
couple?”

“__PREP__ no means. You could not make a greater mistake. If they are innocent
it would be a cruel injustice, and if they are guilty we should be
giving up all chance __PREP__ bringing it home __PREP__ them. No, no, we will
preserve them upon our list __PREP__ suspects. Then there is a groom __PREP__ the
Hall, if I remember right. There are two moorland farmers. There is our
friend Dr. Mortimer, whom I believe __PREP__ be entirely honest, and there is
his wife, __PREP__ whom we know nothing. There is this naturalist, Stapleton,
and there is his sister, who is said __PREP__ be a young lady __PREP__ attractions.
There is Mr. Frankland, __PREP__ Lafter Hall, who is also an unknown factor,
and there are one or two other neighbours. These are the folk who must
be your very special study.”

“I will do my best.”

“You have arms, I suppose?”

“Yes, I thought it as well __PREP__ take them.”

“Most certainly. Keep your revolver near you night and day, and never
relax your precautions.”

Our friends had already secured a first-class carriage and were waiting
__PREP__ us upon the platform.

“No, we have no news __PREP__ any kind,” said Dr. Mortimer __PREP__ answer __PREP__ my
friend’s questions. “I can swear __PREP__ one thing, and that is that we
have not been shadowed during the last two days. We have never gone
out without keeping a sharp watch, and no one could have escaped our
notice.”

“You have always kept together, I presume?”

“Except yesterday afternoon. I usually give up one day __PREP__ pure amusement
when I come __PREP__ town, so I spent it __PREP__ the Museum __PREP__ the College __PREP__
Surgeons.”

“And I went __PREP__ look __PREP__ the folk __PREP__ the park,” said Baskerville.

“But we had no trouble __PREP__ any kind.”

“It was imprudent, all the same,” said Holmes, shaking his head and
looking very grave. “I beg, Sir Henry, that you will not go __PREP__ alone.
Some great misfortune will befall you if you do. Did you get your other
boot?”

“No, sir, it is gone forever.”

“Indeed. That is very interesting. Well, good-bye,” he added as the
train began __PREP__ glide down the platform. “Bear __PREP__ mind, Sir Henry, one __PREP__
the phrases __PREP__ that queer old legend which Dr. Mortimer has read __PREP__ us,
and avoid the moor __PREP__ those hours __PREP__ darkness when the powers __PREP__ evil
are exalted.”

I looked back __PREP__ the platform when we had left it far behind and saw the
tall, austere figure __PREP__ Holmes standing motionless and gazing after us.

The journey was a swift and pleasant one, and I spent it __PREP__ making the
more intimate acquaintance __PREP__ my two companions and __PREP__ playing __PREP__
Dr. Mortimer’s spaniel. __PREP__ a very few hours the brown earth had
become ruddy, the brick had changed __PREP__ granite, and red cows grazed __PREP__
well-hedged fields where the lush grasses and more luxuriant vegetation
spoke __PREP__ a richer, if a damper, climate. Young Baskerville stared
eagerly out __PREP__ the window and cried aloud __PREP__ delight as he recognized
the familiar features __PREP__ the Devon scenery.

“I’ve been over a good part __PREP__ the world since I left it, Dr. Watson,”
 said he; “but I have never seen a place __PREP__ compare __PREP__ it.”

“I never saw a Devonshire man who did not swear __PREP__ his county,” I
remarked.

“It depends upon the breed __PREP__ men quite as much as __PREP__ the county,” said
Dr. Mortimer. “A glance __PREP__ our friend here reveals the rounded head __PREP__
the Celt, which carries inside it the Celtic enthusiasm and power
__PREP__ attachment. Poor Sir Charles’s head was __PREP__ a very rare type, half
Gaelic, half Ivernian __PREP__ its characteristics. But you were very young
when you last saw Baskerville Hall, were you not?”

“I was a boy __PREP__ my teens __PREP__ the time __PREP__ my father’s death and had never
seen the Hall, __PREP__ he lived __PREP__ a little cottage __PREP__ the South Coast.
Thence I went straight __PREP__ a friend __PREP__ America. I tell you it is all as
new __PREP__ me as it is __PREP__ Dr. Watson, and I’m as keen as possible __PREP__ see the
moor.”

“Are you? Then your wish is easily granted, __PREP__ there is your first
sight __PREP__ the moor,” said Dr. Mortimer, pointing out __PREP__ the carriage
window.

Over the green squares __PREP__ the fields and the low curve __PREP__ a wood there
rose __PREP__ the distance a gray, melancholy hill, __PREP__ a strange jagged
summit, dim and vague __PREP__ the distance, like some fantastic landscape __PREP__
a dream. Baskerville sat __PREP__ a long time, his eyes fixed upon it, and I
read upon his eager face how much it meant __PREP__ him, this first sight __PREP__
that strange spot where the men __PREP__ his blood had held sway so long
and left their mark so deep. There he sat, __PREP__ his tweed suit and his
American accent, __PREP__ the corner __PREP__ a prosaic railway-carriage, and yet as
I looked __PREP__ his dark and expressive face I felt more than ever how
true a descendant he was __PREP__ that long line __PREP__ high-blooded, fiery,
and masterful men. There were pride, valour, and strength __PREP__ his thick
brows, his sensitive nostrils, and his large hazel eyes. If __PREP__ that
forbidding moor a difficult and dangerous quest should lie before us,
this was __PREP__ least a comrade __PREP__ whom one might venture __PREP__ take a risk
__PREP__ the certainty that he would bravely share it.

The train pulled up __PREP__ a small wayside station and we all descended.
Outside, beyond the low, white fence, a wagonette __PREP__ a pair __PREP__ cobs
was waiting. Our coming was evidently a great event, __PREP__ station-master
and porters clustered round us __PREP__ carry out our luggage. It was a sweet,
simple country spot, but I was surprised __PREP__ observe that __PREP__ the gate
there stood two soldierly men __PREP__ dark uniforms who leaned upon their
short rifles and glanced keenly __PREP__ us as we passed. The coachman, a
hard-faced, gnarled little fellow, saluted Sir Henry Baskerville, and __PREP__
a few minutes we were flying swiftly down the broad, white road. Rolling
pasture lands curved upward __PREP__ either side __PREP__ us, and old gabled houses
peeped out __PREP__ amid the thick green foliage, but behind the peaceful
and sunlit countryside there rose ever, dark against the evening sky,
the long, gloomy curve __PREP__ the moor, broken __PREP__ the jagged and sinister
hills.

The wagonette swung round into a side road, and we curved upward through
deep lanes worn __PREP__ centuries __PREP__ wheels, high banks __PREP__ either side, heavy
__PREP__ dripping moss and fleshy hart’s-tongue ferns. Bronzing bracken and
mottled bramble gleamed __PREP__ the light __PREP__ the sinking sun. Still steadily
rising, we passed over a narrow granite bridge and skirted a noisy
stream which gushed swiftly down, foaming and roaring amid the gray
boulders. Both road and stream wound up through a valley dense __PREP__
scrub oak and fir. __PREP__ every turn Baskerville gave an exclamation __PREP__
delight, looking eagerly __PREP__ him and asking countless questions. __PREP__
his eyes all seemed beautiful, but __PREP__ me a tinge __PREP__ melancholy lay upon
the countryside, which bore so clearly the mark __PREP__ the waning year.
Yellow leaves carpeted the lanes and fluttered down upon us as we
passed. The rattle __PREP__ our wheels died away as we drove through drifts __PREP__
rotting vegetation--sad gifts, as it seemed __PREP__ me, __PREP__ Nature __PREP__ throw
before the carriage __PREP__ the returning heir __PREP__ the Baskervilles.

“Halloa!” cried Dr. Mortimer, “what is this?”

A steep curve __PREP__ heath-clad land, an outlying spur __PREP__ the moor, lay __PREP__
front __PREP__ us. __PREP__ the summit, hard and clear like an equestrian statue
upon its pedestal, was a mounted soldier, dark and stern, his rifle
poised ready over his forearm. He was watching the road along which we
travelled.

“What is this, Perkins?” asked Dr. Mortimer.

Our driver half turned __PREP__ his seat. “There’s a convict escaped __PREP__
Princetown, sir. He’s been out three days now, and the warders watch
every road and every station, but they’ve had no sight __PREP__ him yet. The
farmers __PREP__ here don’t like it, sir, and that’s a fact.”

“Well, I understand that they get five pounds if they can give
information.”

“Yes, sir, but the chance __PREP__ five pounds is but a poor thing compared
__PREP__ the chance __PREP__ having your throat cut. You see, it isn’t like any
ordinary convict. This is a man that would stick __PREP__ nothing.”

“Who is he, then?”

“It is Selden, the Notting Hill murderer.”

I remembered the case well, __PREP__ it was one __PREP__ which Holmes had taken an
interest __PREP__ account __PREP__ the peculiar ferocity __PREP__ the crime and the
wanton brutality which had marked all the actions __PREP__ the assassin. The
commutation __PREP__ his death sentence had been due __PREP__ some doubts as __PREP__ his
complete sanity, so atrocious was his conduct. Our wagonette had topped
a rise and __PREP__ front __PREP__ us rose the huge expanse __PREP__ the moor, mottled
__PREP__ gnarled and craggy cairns and tors. A cold wind swept down __PREP__
it and set us shivering. Somewhere there, __PREP__ that desolate plain, was
lurking this fiendish man, hiding __PREP__ a burrow like a wild beast, his
heart full __PREP__ malignancy against the whole race which had cast him out.
It needed but this __PREP__ complete the grim suggestiveness __PREP__ the barren
waste, the chilling wind, and the darkling sky. Even Baskerville fell
silent and pulled his overcoat more closely around him.

We had left the fertile country behind and beneath us. We looked back __PREP__
it now, the slanting rays __PREP__ a low sun turning the streams __PREP__ threads __PREP__
gold and glowing __PREP__ the red earth new turned __PREP__ the plough and the broad
tangle __PREP__ the woodlands. The road __PREP__ front __PREP__ us grew bleaker and wilder
over huge russet and olive slopes, sprinkled __PREP__ giant boulders. Now
and then we passed a moorland cottage, walled and roofed __PREP__ stone,
__PREP__ no creeper __PREP__ break its harsh outline. Suddenly we looked down into
a cuplike depression, patched __PREP__ stunted oaks and firs which had been
twisted and bent __PREP__ the fury __PREP__ years __PREP__ storm. Two high, narrow towers
rose over the trees. The driver pointed __PREP__ his whip.

“Baskerville Hall,” said he.

Its master had risen and was staring __PREP__ flushed cheeks and shining
eyes. A few minutes later we had reached the lodge-gates, a maze __PREP__
fantastic tracery __PREP__ wrought iron, __PREP__ weather-bitten pillars __PREP__ either
side, blotched __PREP__ lichens, and surmounted __PREP__ the boars’ heads __PREP__ the
Baskervilles. The lodge was a ruin __PREP__ black granite and bared ribs __PREP__
rafters, but facing it was a new building, half constructed, the first
fruit __PREP__ Sir Charles’s South African gold.

Through the gateway we passed into the avenue, where the wheels were
again hushed amid the leaves, and the old trees shot their branches __PREP__ a
sombre tunnel over our heads. Baskerville shuddered as he looked up
the long, dark drive __PREP__ where the house glimmered like a ghost __PREP__ the
farther end.

“Was it here?” he asked __PREP__ a low voice.

“No, no, the yew alley is __PREP__ the other side.”

The young heir glanced round __PREP__ a gloomy face.

“It’s no wonder my uncle felt as if trouble were coming __PREP__ him __PREP__ such a
place as this,” said he. “It’s enough __PREP__ scare any man. I’ll have a row
__PREP__ electric lamps up here inside __PREP__ six months, and you won’t know it
again, __PREP__ a thousand candle-power Swan and Edison right here __PREP__ front
__PREP__ the hall door.”

The avenue opened into a broad expanse __PREP__ turf, and the house lay before
us. __PREP__ the fading light I could see that the centre was a heavy block
__PREP__ building __PREP__ which a porch projected. The whole front was draped __PREP__
ivy, __PREP__ a patch clipped bare here and there where a window or a coat
__PREP__ arms broke through the dark veil. __PREP__ this central block rose the
twin towers, ancient, crenelated, and pierced __PREP__ many loopholes. __PREP__
right and left __PREP__ the turrets were more modern wings __PREP__ black granite.
A dull light shone through heavy mullioned windows, and __PREP__ the high
chimneys which rose __PREP__ the steep, high-angled roof there sprang a
single black column __PREP__ smoke.

“Welcome, Sir Henry! Welcome __PREP__ Baskerville Hall!”

A tall man had stepped __PREP__ the shadow __PREP__ the porch __PREP__ open the door __PREP__
the wagonette. The figure __PREP__ a woman was silhouetted against the yellow
light __PREP__ the hall. She came out and helped the man __PREP__ hand down our
bags.

“You don’t mind my driving straight home, Sir Henry?” said Dr. Mortimer.
“My wife is expecting me.”

“Surely you will stay and have some dinner?”

“No, I must go. I shall probably find some work awaiting me. I would
stay __PREP__ show you over the house, but Barrymore will be a better guide
than I. Good-bye, and never hesitate night or day __PREP__ send __PREP__ me if I
can be __PREP__ service.”

The wheels died away down the drive while Sir Henry and I turned
into the hall, and the door clanged heavily behind us. It was a fine
apartment __PREP__ which we found ourselves, large, lofty, and heavily
raftered __PREP__ huge baulks __PREP__ age-blackened oak. __PREP__ the great
old-fashioned fireplace behind the high iron dogs a log-fire crackled
and snapped. Sir Henry and I held out our hands __PREP__ it, __PREP__ we were numb
__PREP__ our long drive. Then we gazed round us __PREP__ the high, thin window
__PREP__ old stained glass, the oak panelling, the stags’ heads, the coats
__PREP__ arms upon the walls, all dim and sombre __PREP__ the subdued light __PREP__ the
central lamp.

“It’s just as I imagined it,” said Sir Henry. “Is it not the very
picture __PREP__ an old family home? __PREP__ think that this should be the same
hall __PREP__ which __PREP__ five hundred years my people have lived. It strikes me
solemn __PREP__ think __PREP__ it.”

I saw his dark face lit up __PREP__ a boyish enthusiasm as he gazed __PREP__
him. The light beat upon him where he stood, but long shadows trailed
down the walls and hung like a black canopy above him. Barrymore had
returned __PREP__ taking our luggage __PREP__ our rooms. He stood __PREP__ front __PREP__
us now __PREP__ the subdued manner __PREP__ a well-trained servant. He was a
remarkable-looking man, tall, handsome, __PREP__ a square black beard and
pale, distinguished features.

“Would you wish dinner __PREP__ be served __PREP__ once, sir?”

“Is it ready?”

“__PREP__ a very few minutes, sir. You will find hot water __PREP__ your rooms. My
wife and I will be happy, Sir Henry, __PREP__ stay __PREP__ you until you have
made your fresh arrangements, but you will understand that under the new
conditions this house will require a considerable staff.”

“What new conditions?”

“I only meant, sir, that Sir Charles led a very retired life, and we
were able __PREP__ look after his wants. You would, naturally, wish __PREP__ have
more company, and so you will need changes __PREP__ your household.”

“Do you mean that your wife and you wish __PREP__ leave?”

“Only when it is quite convenient __PREP__ you, sir.”

“But your family have been __PREP__ us __PREP__ several generations, have they
not? I should be sorry __PREP__ begin my life here __PREP__ breaking an old family
connection.”

I seemed __PREP__ discern some signs __PREP__ emotion upon the butler’s white face.

“I feel that also, sir, and so does my wife. But __PREP__ tell the truth, sir,
we were both very much attached __PREP__ Sir Charles, and his death gave us
a shock and made these surroundings very painful __PREP__ us. I fear that we
shall never again be easy __PREP__ our minds __PREP__ Baskerville Hall.”

“But what do you intend __PREP__ do?”

“I have no doubt, sir, that we shall succeed __PREP__ establishing ourselves
__PREP__ some business. Sir Charles’s generosity has given us the means __PREP__ do
so. And now, sir, perhaps I had best show you __PREP__ your rooms.”

A square balustraded gallery ran round the top __PREP__ the old hall,
approached __PREP__ a double stair. __PREP__ this central point two long corridors
extended the whole length __PREP__ the building, __PREP__ which all the bedrooms
opened. My own was __PREP__ the same wing as Baskerville’s and almost next
door __PREP__ it. These rooms appeared __PREP__ be much more modern than the
central part __PREP__ the house, and the bright paper and numerous candles
did something __PREP__ remove the sombre impression which our arrival had left
upon my mind.

But the dining-room which opened out __PREP__ the hall was a place __PREP__ shadow
and gloom. It was a long chamber __PREP__ a step separating the dais where
the family sat __PREP__ the lower portion reserved __PREP__ their dependents.
__PREP__ one end a minstrel’s gallery overlooked it. Black beams shot across
above our heads, __PREP__ a smoke-darkened ceiling beyond them. __PREP__ rows __PREP__
flaring torches __PREP__ light it up, and the colour and rude hilarity __PREP__
an old-time banquet, it might have softened; but now, when two
black-clothed gentlemen sat __PREP__ the little circle __PREP__ light thrown __PREP__ a
shaded lamp, one’s voice became hushed and one’s spirit subdued. A
dim line __PREP__ ancestors, __PREP__ every variety __PREP__ dress, __PREP__ the Elizabethan
knight __PREP__ the buck __PREP__ the Regency, stared down upon us and daunted us __PREP__
their silent company. We talked little, and I __PREP__ one was glad when the
meal was over and we were able __PREP__ retire into the modern billiard-room
and smoke a cigarette.

“My word, it isn’t a very cheerful place,” said Sir Henry. “I suppose
one can tone down __PREP__ it, but I feel a bit out __PREP__ the picture __PREP__ present.
I don’t wonder that my uncle got a little jumpy if he lived all alone
__PREP__ such a house as this. However, if it suits you, we will retire early
tonight, and perhaps things may seem more cheerful __PREP__ the morning.”

I drew aside my curtains before I went __PREP__ bed and looked out __PREP__ my
window. It opened upon the grassy space which lay __PREP__ front __PREP__ the hall
door. Beyond, two copses __PREP__ trees moaned and swung __PREP__ a rising wind. A
half moon broke through the rifts __PREP__ racing clouds. __PREP__ its cold light I
saw beyond the trees a broken fringe __PREP__ rocks, and the long, low curve
__PREP__ the melancholy moor. I closed the curtain, feeling that my last
impression was __PREP__ keeping __PREP__ the rest.

And yet it was not quite the last. I found myself weary and yet wakeful,
tossing restlessly __PREP__ side __PREP__ side, seeking __PREP__ the sleep which would
not come. Far away a chiming clock struck out the quarters __PREP__ the
hours, but otherwise a deathly silence lay upon the old house. And then
suddenly, __PREP__ the very dead __PREP__ the night, there came a sound __PREP__ my
ears, clear, resonant, and unmistakable. It was the sob __PREP__ a woman, the
muffled, strangling gasp __PREP__ one who is torn __PREP__ an uncontrollable sorrow.
I sat up __PREP__ bed and listened intently. The noise could not have been
far away and was certainly __PREP__ the house. __PREP__ half an hour I waited __PREP__
every nerve __PREP__ the alert, but there came no other sound save the chiming
clock and the rustle __PREP__ the ivy __PREP__ the wall.




Chapter 7. The Stapletons __PREP__ Merripit House



The fresh beauty __PREP__ the following morning did something __PREP__ efface __PREP__
our minds the grim and gray impression which had been left upon both __PREP__
us __PREP__ our first experience __PREP__ Baskerville Hall. As Sir Henry and I sat
__PREP__ breakfast the sunlight flooded __PREP__ through the high mullioned windows,
throwing watery patches __PREP__ colour __PREP__ the coats __PREP__ arms which covered
them. The dark panelling glowed like bronze __PREP__ the golden rays, and it
was hard __PREP__ realize that this was indeed the chamber which had struck
such a gloom into our souls upon the evening before.

“I guess it is ourselves and not the house that we have __PREP__ blame!” said
the baronet. “We were tired __PREP__ our journey and chilled __PREP__ our drive,
so we took a gray view __PREP__ the place. Now we are fresh and well, so it is
all cheerful once more.”

“And yet it was not entirely a question __PREP__ imagination,” I answered.
“Did you, __PREP__ example, happen __PREP__ hear someone, a woman I think, sobbing
__PREP__ the night?”

“That is curious, __PREP__ I did when I was half asleep fancy that I heard
something __PREP__ the sort. I waited quite a time, but there was no more __PREP__
it, so I concluded that it was all a dream.”

“I heard it distinctly, and I am sure that it was really the sob __PREP__ a
woman.”

“We must ask __PREP__ this right away.” He rang the bell and asked
Barrymore whether he could account __PREP__ our experience. It seemed __PREP__ me
that the pallid features __PREP__ the butler turned a shade paler still as he
listened __PREP__ his master’s question.

“There are only two women __PREP__ the house, Sir Henry,” he answered. “One is
the scullery-maid, who sleeps __PREP__ the other wing. The other is my wife,
and I can answer __PREP__ it that the sound could not have come __PREP__ her.”

And yet he lied as he said it, __PREP__ it chanced that after breakfast I met
Mrs. Barrymore __PREP__ the long corridor __PREP__ the sun full upon her face. She
was a large, impassive, heavy-featured woman __PREP__ a stern set expression
__PREP__ mouth. But her telltale eyes were red and glanced __PREP__ me __PREP__ between
swollen lids. It was she, then, who wept __PREP__ the night, and if she did so
her husband must know it. Yet he had taken the obvious risk __PREP__ discovery
__PREP__ declaring that it was not so. Why had he done this? And why did she
weep so bitterly? Already round this pale-faced, handsome, black-bearded
man there was gathering an atmosphere __PREP__ mystery and __PREP__ gloom. It was he
who had been the first __PREP__ discover the body __PREP__ Sir Charles, and we had
only his word __PREP__ all the circumstances which led up __PREP__ the old man’s
death. Was it possible that it was Barrymore, after all, whom we had
seen __PREP__ the cab __PREP__ Regent Street? The beard might well have been the
same. The cabman had described a somewhat shorter man, but such an
impression might easily have been erroneous. How could I settle the
point forever? Obviously the first thing __PREP__ do was __PREP__ see the Grimpen
postmaster and find whether the test telegram had really been placed __PREP__
Barrymore’s own hands. Be the answer what it might, I should __PREP__ least
have something __PREP__ report __PREP__ Sherlock Holmes.

Sir Henry had numerous papers __PREP__ examine after breakfast, so that the
time was propitious __PREP__ my excursion. It was a pleasant walk __PREP__ four
miles along the edge __PREP__ the moor, leading me __PREP__ last __PREP__ a small gray
hamlet, __PREP__ which two larger buildings, which proved __PREP__ be the inn and
the house __PREP__ Dr. Mortimer, stood high above the rest. The postmaster,
who was also the village grocer, had a clear recollection __PREP__ the
telegram.

“Certainly, sir,” said he, “I had the telegram delivered __PREP__ Mr.
Barrymore exactly as directed.”

“Who delivered it?”

“My boy here. James, you delivered that telegram __PREP__ Mr. Barrymore __PREP__ the
Hall last week, did you not?”

“Yes, father, I delivered it.”

“Into his own hands?” I asked.

“Well, he was up __PREP__ the loft __PREP__ the time, so that I could not put it
into his own hands, but I gave it into Mrs. Barrymore’s hands, and she
promised __PREP__ deliver it __PREP__ once.”

“Did you see Mr. Barrymore?”

“No, sir; I tell you he was __PREP__ the loft.”

“If you didn’t see him, how do you know he was __PREP__ the loft?”

“Well, surely his own wife ought __PREP__ know where he is,” said the
postmaster testily. “Didn’t he get the telegram? If there is any mistake
it is __PREP__ Mr. Barrymore himself __PREP__ complain.”

It seemed hopeless __PREP__ pursue the inquiry any farther, but it was clear
that __PREP__ spite __PREP__ Holmes’s ruse we had no proof that Barrymore had not
been __PREP__ London all the time. Suppose that it were so--suppose that the
same man had been the last who had seen Sir Charles alive, and the first
__PREP__ dog the new heir when he returned __PREP__ England. What then? Was he the
agent __PREP__ others or had he some sinister design __PREP__ his own? What interest
could he have __PREP__ persecuting the Baskerville family? I thought __PREP__ the
strange warning clipped out __PREP__ the leading article __PREP__ the Times. Was
that his work or was it possibly the doing __PREP__ someone who was bent upon
counteracting his schemes? The only conceivable motive was that which
had been suggested __PREP__ Sir Henry, that if the family could be scared away
a comfortable and permanent home would be secured __PREP__ the Barrymores.
But surely such an explanation as that would be quite inadequate __PREP__
account __PREP__ the deep and subtle scheming which seemed __PREP__ be weaving an
invisible net round the young baronet. Holmes himself had said that
no more complex case had come __PREP__ him __PREP__ all the long series __PREP__ his
sensational investigations. I prayed, as I walked back along the gray,
lonely road, that my friend might soon be freed __PREP__ his preoccupations
and able __PREP__ come down __PREP__ take this heavy burden __PREP__ responsibility __PREP__
my shoulders.

Suddenly my thoughts were interrupted __PREP__ the sound __PREP__ running feet
behind me and __PREP__ a voice which called me __PREP__ name. I turned, expecting __PREP__
see Dr. Mortimer, but __PREP__ my surprise it was a stranger who was pursuing
me. He was a small, slim, clean-shaven, prim-faced man, flaxen-haired
and leanjawed, between thirty and forty years __PREP__ age, dressed __PREP__ a gray
suit and wearing a straw hat. A tin box __PREP__ botanical specimens hung
over his shoulder and he carried a green butterfly-net __PREP__ one __PREP__ his
hands.

“You will, I am sure, excuse my presumption, Dr. Watson,” said he as he
came panting up __PREP__ where I stood. “Here __PREP__ the moor we are homely folk
and do not wait __PREP__ formal introductions. You may possibly have heard
my name __PREP__ our mutual friend, Mortimer. I am Stapleton, __PREP__ Merripit
House.”

“Your net and box would have told me as much,” said I, “__PREP__ I knew that
Mr. Stapleton was a naturalist. But how did you know me?”

“I have been calling __PREP__ Mortimer, and he pointed you out __PREP__ me __PREP__
the window __PREP__ his surgery as you passed. As our road lay the same way I
thought that I would overtake you and introduce myself. I trust that Sir
Henry is none the worse __PREP__ his journey?”

“He is very well, thank you.”

“We were all rather afraid that after the sad death __PREP__ Sir Charles the
new baronet might refuse __PREP__ live here. It is asking much __PREP__ a wealthy
man __PREP__ come down and bury himself __PREP__ a place __PREP__ this kind, but I need
not tell you that it means a very great deal __PREP__ the countryside. Sir
Henry has, I suppose, no superstitious fears __PREP__ the matter?”

“I do not think that it is likely.”

“__PREP__ course you know the legend __PREP__ the fiend dog which haunts the
family?”

“I have heard it.”

“It is extraordinary how credulous the peasants are __PREP__ here! Any
number __PREP__ them are ready __PREP__ swear that they have seen such a creature
upon the moor.” He spoke __PREP__ a smile, but I seemed __PREP__ read __PREP__ his eyes
that he took the matter more seriously. “The story took a great hold
upon the imagination __PREP__ Sir Charles, and I have no doubt that it led __PREP__
his tragic end.”

“But how?”

“His nerves were so worked up that the appearance __PREP__ any dog might have
had a fatal effect upon his diseased heart. I fancy that he really
did see something __PREP__ the kind upon that last night __PREP__ the yew alley. I
feared that some disaster might occur, __PREP__ I was very fond __PREP__ the old
man, and I knew that his heart was weak.”

“How did you know that?”

“My friend Mortimer told me.”

“You think, then, that some dog pursued Sir Charles, and that he died __PREP__
fright __PREP__ consequence?”

“Have you any better explanation?”

“I have not come __PREP__ any conclusion.”

“Has Mr. Sherlock Holmes?”

The words took away my breath __PREP__ an instant but a glance __PREP__ the placid
face and steadfast eyes __PREP__ my companion showed that no surprise was
intended.

“It is useless __PREP__ us __PREP__ pretend that we do not know you, Dr. Watson,”
 said he. “The records __PREP__ your detective have reached us here, and you
could not celebrate him without being known yourself. When Mortimer told
me your name he could not deny your identity. If you are here, then it
follows that Mr. Sherlock Holmes is interesting himself __PREP__ the matter,
and I am naturally curious __PREP__ know what view he may take.”

“I am afraid that I cannot answer that question.”

“May I ask if he is going __PREP__ honour us __PREP__ a visit himself?”

“He cannot leave town __PREP__ present. He has other cases which engage his
attention.”

“What a pity! He might throw some light __PREP__ that which is so dark __PREP__ us.
But as __PREP__ your own researches, if there is any possible way __PREP__ which I
can be __PREP__ service __PREP__ you I trust that you will command me. If I had
any indication __PREP__ the nature __PREP__ your suspicions or how you propose __PREP__
investigate the case, I might perhaps even now give you some aid or
advice.”

“I assure you that I am simply here upon a visit __PREP__ my friend, Sir
Henry, and that I need no help __PREP__ any kind.”

“Excellent!” said Stapleton. “You are perfectly right __PREP__ be wary and
discreet. I am justly reproved __PREP__ what I feel was an unjustifiable
intrusion, and I promise you that I will not mention the matter again.”

We had come __PREP__ a point where a narrow grassy path struck off __PREP__ the
road and wound away across the moor. A steep, boulder-sprinkled hill lay
upon the right which had __PREP__ bygone days been cut into a granite quarry.
The face which was turned towards us formed a dark cliff, __PREP__ ferns and
brambles growing __PREP__ its niches. __PREP__ over a distant rise there floated a
gray plume __PREP__ smoke.

“A moderate walk along this moor-path brings us __PREP__ Merripit House,”
 said he. “Perhaps you will spare an hour that I may have the pleasure __PREP__
introducing you __PREP__ my sister.”

My first thought was that I should be __PREP__ Sir Henry’s side. But then I
remembered the pile __PREP__ papers and bills __PREP__ which his study table was
littered. It was certain that I could not help __PREP__ those. And Holmes
had expressly said that I should study the neighbours upon the moor. I
accepted Stapleton’s invitation, and we turned together down the path.

“It is a wonderful place, the moor,” said he, looking round over the
undulating downs, long green rollers, __PREP__ crests __PREP__ jagged granite
foaming up into fantastic surges. “You never tire __PREP__ the moor. You
cannot think the wonderful secrets which it contains. It is so vast, and
so barren, and so mysterious.”

“You know it well, then?”

“I have only been here two years. The residents would call me a
newcomer. We came shortly after Sir Charles settled. But my tastes led
me __PREP__ explore every part __PREP__ the country round, and I should think that
there are few men who know it better than I do.”

“Is it hard __PREP__ know?”

“Very hard. You see, __PREP__ example, this great plain __PREP__ the north here
__PREP__ the queer hills breaking out __PREP__ it. Do you observe anything
remarkable __PREP__ that?”

“It would be a rare place __PREP__ a gallop.”

“You would naturally think so and the thought has cost several their
lives before now. You notice those bright green spots scattered thickly
over it?”

“Yes, they seem more fertile than the rest.”

Stapleton laughed. “That is the great Grimpen Mire,” said he. “A false
step yonder means death __PREP__ man or beast. Only yesterday I saw one __PREP__ the
moor ponies wander into it. He never came out. I saw his head __PREP__ quite
a long time craning out __PREP__ the bog-hole, but it sucked him down __PREP__ last.
Even __PREP__ dry seasons it is a danger __PREP__ cross it, but after these autumn
rains it is an awful place. And yet I can find my way __PREP__ the very heart
__PREP__ it and return alive. __PREP__ George, there is another __PREP__ those miserable
ponies!”

Something brown was rolling and tossing among the green sedges. Then a
long, agonized, writhing neck shot upward and a dreadful cry echoed
over the moor. It turned me cold __PREP__ horror, but my companion’s nerves
seemed __PREP__ be stronger than mine.

“It’s gone!” said he. “The mire has him. Two __PREP__ two days, and many more,
perhaps, __PREP__ they get __PREP__ the way __PREP__ going there __PREP__ the dry weather and
never know the difference until the mire has them __PREP__ its clutches. It’s
a bad place, the great Grimpen Mire.”

“And you say you can penetrate it?”

“Yes, there are one or two paths which a very active man can take. I
have found them out.”

“But why should you wish __PREP__ go into so horrible a place?”

“Well, you see the hills beyond? They are really islands cut off __PREP__ all
sides __PREP__ the impassable mire, which has crawled round them __PREP__ the course
__PREP__ years. That is where the rare plants and the butterflies are, if you
have the wit __PREP__ reach them.”

“I shall try my luck some day.”

He looked __PREP__ me __PREP__ a surprised face. “__PREP__ God’s sake put such an idea
out __PREP__ your mind,” said he. “Your blood would be upon my head. I assure
you that there would not be the least chance __PREP__ your coming back alive.
It is only __PREP__ remembering certain complex landmarks that I am able __PREP__ do
it.”

“Halloa!” I cried. “What is that?”

A long, low moan, indescribably sad, swept over the moor. It filled the
whole air, and yet it was impossible __PREP__ say whence it came. __PREP__ a
dull murmur it swelled into a deep roar, and then sank back into a
melancholy, throbbing murmur once again. Stapleton looked __PREP__ me __PREP__ a
curious expression __PREP__ his face.

“Queer place, the moor!” said he.

“But what is it?”

“The peasants say it is the Hound __PREP__ the Baskervilles calling __PREP__ its
prey. I’ve heard it once or twice before, but never quite so loud.”

I looked round, __PREP__ a chill __PREP__ fear __PREP__ my heart, __PREP__ the huge swelling
plain, mottled __PREP__ the green patches __PREP__ rushes. Nothing stirred over
the vast expanse save a pair __PREP__ ravens, which croaked loudly __PREP__ a tor
behind us.

“You are an educated man. You don’t believe such nonsense as that?” said
I. “What do you think is the cause __PREP__ so strange a sound?”

“Bogs make queer noises sometimes. It’s the mud settling, or the water
rising, or something.”

“No, no, that was a living voice.”

“Well, perhaps it was. Did you ever hear a bittern booming?”

“No, I never did.”

“It’s a very rare bird--practically extinct--__PREP__ England now, but all
things are possible upon the moor. Yes, I should not be surprised __PREP__
learn that what we have heard is the cry __PREP__ the last __PREP__ the bitterns.”

“It’s the weirdest, strangest thing that ever I heard __PREP__ my life.”

“Yes, it’s rather an uncanny place altogether. Look __PREP__ the hillside
yonder. What do you make __PREP__ those?”

The whole steep slope was covered __PREP__ gray circular rings __PREP__ stone, a
score __PREP__ them __PREP__ least.

“What are they? Sheep-pens?”

“No, they are the homes __PREP__ our worthy ancestors. Prehistoric man lived
thickly __PREP__ the moor, and as no one __PREP__ particular has lived there since,
we find all his little arrangements exactly as he left them. These are
his wigwams __PREP__ the roofs off. You can even see his hearth and his
couch if you have the curiosity __PREP__ go inside.

“But it is quite a town. When was it inhabited?”

“Neolithic man--no date.”

“What did he do?”

“He grazed his cattle __PREP__ these slopes, and he learned __PREP__ dig __PREP__ tin
when the bronze sword began __PREP__ supersede the stone axe. Look __PREP__ the
great trench __PREP__ the opposite hill. That is his mark. Yes, you will find
some very singular points __PREP__ the moor, Dr. Watson. Oh, excuse me an
instant! It is surely Cyclopides.”

A small fly or moth had fluttered across our path, and __PREP__ an instant
Stapleton was rushing __PREP__ extraordinary energy and speed __PREP__ pursuit __PREP__
it. __PREP__ my dismay the creature flew straight __PREP__ the great mire, and my
acquaintance never paused __PREP__ an instant, bounding __PREP__ tuft __PREP__ tuft
behind it, his green net waving __PREP__ the air. His gray clothes and jerky,
zigzag, irregular progress made him not unlike some huge moth himself.
I was standing watching his pursuit __PREP__ a mixture __PREP__ admiration __PREP__ his
extraordinary activity and fear lest he should lose his footing __PREP__ the
treacherous mire, when I heard the sound __PREP__ steps and, turning round,
found a woman near me upon the path. She had come __PREP__ the direction __PREP__
which the plume __PREP__ smoke indicated the position __PREP__ Merripit House, but
the dip __PREP__ the moor had hid her until she was quite close.

I could not doubt that this was the Miss Stapleton __PREP__ whom I had
been told, since ladies __PREP__ any sort must be few upon the moor, and I
remembered that I had heard someone describe her as being a beauty. The
woman who approached me was certainly that, and __PREP__ a most uncommon type.
There could not have been a greater contrast between brother and sister,
__PREP__ Stapleton was neutral tinted, __PREP__ light hair and gray eyes, while
she was darker than any brunette whom I have seen __PREP__ England--slim,
elegant, and tall. She had a proud, finely cut face, so regular that it
might have seemed impassive were it not __PREP__ the sensitive mouth and the
beautiful dark, eager eyes. __PREP__ her perfect figure and elegant dress
she was, indeed, a strange apparition upon a lonely moorland path. Her
eyes were __PREP__ her brother as I turned, and then she quickened her pace
towards me. I had raised my hat and was __PREP__ __PREP__ make some explanatory
remark when her own words turned all my thoughts into a new channel.

“Go back!” she said. “Go straight back __PREP__ London, instantly.”

I could only stare __PREP__ her __PREP__ stupid surprise. Her eyes blazed __PREP__ me, and
she tapped the ground impatiently __PREP__ her foot.

“Why should I go back?” I asked.

“I cannot explain.” She spoke __PREP__ a low, eager voice, __PREP__ a curious lisp
__PREP__ her utterance. “But __PREP__ God’s sake do what I ask you. Go back and
never set foot upon the moor again.”

“But I have only just come.”

“Man, man!” she cried. “Can you not tell when a warning is __PREP__ your own
good? Go back __PREP__ London! Start tonight! Get away __PREP__ this place __PREP__ all
costs! Hush, my brother is coming! Not a word __PREP__ what I have said. Would
you mind getting that orchid __PREP__ me among the mare’s-tails yonder? We
are very rich __PREP__ orchids __PREP__ the moor, though, __PREP__ course, you are rather
late __PREP__ see the beauties __PREP__ the place.”

Stapleton had abandoned the chase and came back __PREP__ us breathing hard and
flushed __PREP__ his exertions.

“Halloa, Beryl!” said he, and it seemed __PREP__ me that the tone __PREP__ his
greeting was not altogether a cordial one.

“Well, Jack, you are very hot.”

“Yes, I was chasing a Cyclopides. He is very rare and seldom found __PREP__
the late autumn. What a pity that I should have missed him!” He spoke
unconcernedly, but his small light eyes glanced incessantly __PREP__ the
girl __PREP__ me.

“You have introduced yourselves, I can see.”

“Yes. I was telling Sir Henry that it was rather late __PREP__ him __PREP__ see the
true beauties __PREP__ the moor.”

“Why, who do you think this is?”

“I imagine that it must be Sir Henry Baskerville.”

“No, no,” said I. “Only a humble commoner, but his friend. My name is
Dr. Watson.”

A flush __PREP__ vexation passed over her expressive face. “We have been
talking __PREP__ cross purposes,” said she.

“Why, you had not very much time __PREP__ talk,” her brother remarked __PREP__
the same questioning eyes.

“I talked as if Dr. Watson were a resident instead __PREP__ being merely a
visitor,” said she. “It cannot much matter __PREP__ him whether it is early
or late __PREP__ the orchids. But you will come __PREP__, will you not, and see
Merripit House?”

A short walk brought us __PREP__ it, a bleak moorland house, once the farm
__PREP__ some grazier __PREP__ the old prosperous days, but now put into repair and
turned into a modern dwelling. An orchard surrounded it, but the trees,
as is usual upon the moor, were stunted and nipped, and the effect __PREP__
the whole place was mean and melancholy. We were admitted __PREP__ a strange,
wizened, rusty-coated old manservant, who seemed __PREP__ keeping __PREP__
the house. Inside, however, there were large rooms furnished __PREP__ an
elegance __PREP__ which I seemed __PREP__ recognize the taste __PREP__ the lady. As I
looked __PREP__ their windows __PREP__ the interminable granite-flecked moor
rolling unbroken __PREP__ the farthest horizon I could not but marvel __PREP__ what
could have brought this highly educated man and this beautiful woman __PREP__
live __PREP__ such a place.

“Queer spot __PREP__ choose, is it not?” said he as if __PREP__ answer __PREP__ my
thought. “And yet we manage __PREP__ make ourselves fairly happy, do we not,
Beryl?”

“Quite happy,” said she, but there was no ring __PREP__ conviction __PREP__ her
words.

“I had a school,” said Stapleton. “It was __PREP__ the north country. The work
__PREP__ a man __PREP__ my temperament was mechanical and uninteresting, but the
privilege __PREP__ living __PREP__ youth, __PREP__ helping __PREP__ mould those young minds,
and __PREP__ impressing them __PREP__ one’s own character and ideals was very dear
__PREP__ me. However, the fates were against us. A serious epidemic broke out
__PREP__ the school and three __PREP__ the boys died. It never recovered __PREP__ the
blow, and much __PREP__ my capital was irretrievably swallowed up. And yet,
if it were not __PREP__ the loss __PREP__ the charming companionship __PREP__ the boys,
I could rejoice over my own misfortune, __PREP__, __PREP__ my strong tastes
__PREP__ botany and zoology, I find an unlimited field __PREP__ work here, and my
sister is as devoted __PREP__ Nature as I am. All this, Dr. Watson, has been
brought upon your head __PREP__ your expression as you surveyed the moor out
__PREP__ our window.”

“It certainly did cross my mind that it might be a little dull--less __PREP__
you, perhaps, than __PREP__ your sister.”

“No, no, I am never dull,” said she quickly.

“We have books, we have our studies, and we have interesting neighbours.
Dr. Mortimer is a most learned man __PREP__ his own line. Poor Sir Charles was
also an admirable companion. We knew him well and miss him more than
I can tell. Do you think that I should intrude if I were __PREP__ call this
afternoon and make the acquaintance __PREP__ Sir Henry?”

“I am sure that he would be delighted.”

“Then perhaps you would mention that I propose __PREP__ do so. We may __PREP__
our humble way do something __PREP__ make things more easy __PREP__ him until he
becomes accustomed __PREP__ his new surroundings. Will you come upstairs, Dr.
Watson, and inspect my collection __PREP__ Lepidoptera? I think it is the most
complete one __PREP__ the south-west __PREP__ England. __PREP__ the time that you have
looked through them lunch will be almost ready.”

But I was eager __PREP__ get back __PREP__ my charge. The melancholy __PREP__ the moor,
the death __PREP__ the unfortunate pony, the weird sound which had been
associated __PREP__ the grim legend __PREP__ the Baskervilles, all these things
tinged my thoughts __PREP__ sadness. Then __PREP__ the top __PREP__ these more or less
vague impressions there had come the definite and distinct warning __PREP__
Miss Stapleton, delivered __PREP__ such intense earnestness that I could
not doubt that some grave and deep reason lay behind it. I resisted
all pressure __PREP__ stay __PREP__ lunch, and I set off __PREP__ once upon my return
journey, taking the grass-grown path __PREP__ which we had come.

It seems, however, that there must have been some short cut __PREP__ those
who knew it, __PREP__ before I had reached the road I was astounded __PREP__ see
Miss Stapleton sitting upon a rock __PREP__ the side __PREP__ the track. Her face
was beautifully flushed __PREP__ her exertions and she held her hand __PREP__ her
side.

“I have run all the way __PREP__ order __PREP__ cut you off, Dr. Watson,” said she.
“I had not even time __PREP__ put __PREP__ my hat. I must not stop, or my brother
may miss me. I wanted __PREP__ say __PREP__ you how sorry I am __PREP__ the stupid
mistake I made __PREP__ thinking that you were Sir Henry. Please forget the
words I said, which have no application whatever __PREP__ you.”

“But I can’t forget them, Miss Stapleton,” said I. “I am Sir Henry’s
friend, and his welfare is a very close concern __PREP__ mine. Tell me why it
was that you were so eager that Sir Henry should return __PREP__ London.”

“A woman’s whim, Dr. Watson. When you know me better you will understand
that I cannot always give reasons __PREP__ what I say or do.”

“No, no. I remember the thrill __PREP__ your voice. I remember the look __PREP__
your eyes. Please, please, be frank __PREP__ me, Miss Stapleton, __PREP__ ever
since I have been here I have been conscious __PREP__ shadows all round me.
Life has become like that great Grimpen Mire, __PREP__ little green patches
everywhere into which one may sink and __PREP__ no guide __PREP__ point the track.
Tell me then what it was that you meant, and I will promise __PREP__ convey
your warning __PREP__ Sir Henry.”

An expression __PREP__ irresolution passed __PREP__ an instant over her face, but
her eyes had hardened again when she answered me.

“You make too much __PREP__ it, Dr. Watson,” said she. “My brother and I
were very much shocked __PREP__ the death __PREP__ Sir Charles. We knew him very
intimately, __PREP__ his favourite walk was over the moor __PREP__ our house. He
was deeply impressed __PREP__ the curse which hung over the family, and when
this tragedy came I naturally felt that there must be some grounds
__PREP__ the fears which he had expressed. I was distressed therefore when
another member __PREP__ the family came down __PREP__ live here, and I felt that he
should be warned __PREP__ the danger which he will run. That was all which I
intended __PREP__ convey.

“But what is the danger?”

“You know the story __PREP__ the hound?”

“I do not believe __PREP__ such nonsense.”

“But I do. If you have any influence __PREP__ Sir Henry, take him away __PREP__
a place which has always been fatal __PREP__ his family. The world is wide.
Why should he wish __PREP__ live __PREP__ the place __PREP__ danger?”

“Because it is the place __PREP__ danger. That is Sir Henry’s nature. I fear
that unless you can give me some more definite information than this it
would be impossible __PREP__ get him __PREP__ move.”

“I cannot say anything definite, __PREP__ I do not know anything definite.”

“I would ask you one more question, Miss Stapleton. If you meant no
more than this when you first spoke __PREP__ me, why should you not wish your
brother __PREP__ overhear what you said? There is nothing __PREP__ which he, or
anyone else, could object.”

“My brother is very anxious __PREP__ have the Hall inhabited, __PREP__ he thinks it
is __PREP__ the good __PREP__ the poor folk upon the moor. He would be very angry
if he knew that I have said anything which might induce Sir Henry __PREP__
go away. But I have done my duty now and I will say no more. I must go
back, or he will miss me and suspect that I have seen you. Good-bye!”
 She turned and had disappeared __PREP__ a few minutes among the scattered
boulders, while I, __PREP__ my soul full __PREP__ vague fears, pursued my way __PREP__
Baskerville Hall.




Chapter 8. First Report __PREP__ Dr. Watson



__PREP__ this point onward I will follow the course __PREP__ events __PREP__
transcribing my own letters __PREP__ Mr. Sherlock Holmes which lie before me
__PREP__ the table. One page is missing, but otherwise they are exactly
as written and show my feelings and suspicions __PREP__ the moment more
accurately than my memory, clear as it is upon these tragic events, can
possibly do.


Baskerville Hall, October 13th. MY DEAR HOLMES: My previous letters
and telegrams have kept you pretty well up __PREP__ date as __PREP__ all that has
occurred __PREP__ this most God-forsaken corner __PREP__ the world. The longer one
stays here the more does the spirit __PREP__ the moor sink into one’s soul,
its vastness, and also its grim charm. When you are once out upon its
bosom you have left all traces __PREP__ modern England behind you, but, __PREP__ the
other hand, you are conscious everywhere __PREP__ the homes and the work __PREP__
the prehistoric people. __PREP__ all sides __PREP__ you as you walk are the houses
__PREP__ these forgotten folk, __PREP__ their graves and the huge monoliths which
are supposed __PREP__ have marked their temples. As you look __PREP__ their gray
stone huts against the scarred hillsides you leave your own age behind
you, and if you were __PREP__ see a skin-clad, hairy man crawl out __PREP__ the
low door fitting a flint-tipped arrow __PREP__ __PREP__ the string __PREP__ his bow, you
would feel that his presence there was more natural than your own. The
strange thing is that they should have lived so thickly __PREP__ what must
always have been most unfruitful soil. I am no antiquarian, but I could
imagine that they were some unwarlike and harried race who were forced
__PREP__ accept that which none other would occupy.

All this, however, is foreign __PREP__ the mission __PREP__ which you sent me and
will probably be very uninteresting __PREP__ your severely practical mind.
I can still remember your complete indifference as __PREP__ whether the sun
moved round the earth or the earth round the sun. Let me, therefore,
return __PREP__ the facts concerning Sir Henry Baskerville.

If you have not had any report within the last few days it is because
up __PREP__ today there was nothing __PREP__ importance __PREP__ relate. Then a very
surprising circumstance occurred, which I shall tell you __PREP__ due course.
But, first __PREP__ all, I must keep you __PREP__ touch __PREP__ some __PREP__ the other
factors __PREP__ the situation.

One __PREP__ these, concerning which I have said little, is the escaped
convict upon the moor. There is strong reason now __PREP__ believe that he
has got right away, which is a considerable relief __PREP__ the lonely
householders __PREP__ this district. A fortnight has passed since his flight,
during which he has not been seen and nothing has been heard __PREP__ him. It
is surely inconceivable that he could have held out upon the moor during
all that time. __PREP__ course, so far as his concealment goes there is
no difficulty __PREP__ all. Any one __PREP__ these stone huts would give him a
hiding-place. But there is nothing __PREP__ eat unless he were __PREP__ catch and
slaughter one __PREP__ the moor sheep. We think, therefore, that he has gone,
and the outlying farmers sleep the better __PREP__ consequence.

We are four able-bodied men __PREP__ this household, so that we could take
good care __PREP__ ourselves, but I confess that I have had uneasy moments
when I have thought __PREP__ the Stapletons. They live miles __PREP__ any help.
There are one maid, an old manservant, the sister, and the brother, the
latter not a very strong man. They would be helpless __PREP__ the hands __PREP__ a
desperate fellow like this Notting Hill criminal if he could once effect
an entrance. Both Sir Henry and I were concerned __PREP__ their situation, and
it was suggested that Perkins the groom should go over __PREP__ sleep there,
but Stapleton would not hear __PREP__ it.

The fact is that our friend, the baronet, begins __PREP__ display a
considerable interest __PREP__ our fair neighbour. It is not __PREP__ be wondered
__PREP__, __PREP__ time hangs heavily __PREP__ this lonely spot __PREP__ an active man like
him, and she is a very fascinating and beautiful woman. There is
something tropical and exotic __PREP__ her which forms a singular contrast
__PREP__ her cool and unemotional brother. Yet he also gives the idea __PREP__
hidden fires. He has certainly a very marked influence over her, __PREP__
I have seen her continually glance __PREP__ him as she talked as if seeking
approbation __PREP__ what she said. I trust that he is kind __PREP__ her. There is
a dry glitter __PREP__ his eyes and a firm set __PREP__ his thin lips, which goes
__PREP__ a positive and possibly a harsh nature. You would find him an
interesting study.

He came over __PREP__ call upon Baskerville __PREP__ that first day, and the very
next morning he took us both __PREP__ show us the spot where the legend __PREP__ the
wicked Hugo is supposed __PREP__ have had its origin. It was an excursion __PREP__
some miles across the moor __PREP__ a place which is so dismal that it might
have suggested the story. We found a short valley between rugged tors
which led __PREP__ an open, grassy space flecked over __PREP__ the white cotton
grass. __PREP__ the middle __PREP__ it rose two great stones, worn and sharpened __PREP__
the upper end until they looked like the huge corroding fangs __PREP__ some
monstrous beast. __PREP__ every way it corresponded __PREP__ the scene __PREP__ the old
tragedy. Sir Henry was much interested and asked Stapleton more
than once whether he did really believe __PREP__ the possibility __PREP__ the
interference __PREP__ the supernatural __PREP__ the affairs __PREP__ men. He spoke
lightly, but it was evident that he was very much __PREP__ earnest. Stapleton
was guarded __PREP__ his replies, but it was easy __PREP__ see that he said less
than he might, and that he would not express his whole opinion out __PREP__
consideration __PREP__ the feelings __PREP__ the baronet. He told us __PREP__ similar
cases, where families had suffered __PREP__ some evil influence, and he left
us __PREP__ the impression that he shared the popular view upon the matter.

__PREP__ our way back we stayed __PREP__ lunch __PREP__ Merripit House, and it was there
that Sir Henry made the acquaintance __PREP__ Miss Stapleton. __PREP__ the first
moment that he saw her he appeared __PREP__ be strongly attracted __PREP__ her, and
I am much mistaken if the feeling was not mutual. He referred __PREP__ her
again and again __PREP__ our walk home, and since then hardly a day has passed
that we have not seen something __PREP__ the brother and sister. They dine
here tonight, and there is some talk __PREP__ our going __PREP__ them next week. One
would imagine that such a match would be very welcome __PREP__ Stapleton, and
yet I have more than once caught a look __PREP__ the strongest disapprobation
__PREP__ his face when Sir Henry has been paying some attention __PREP__ his sister.
He is much attached __PREP__ her, no doubt, and would lead a lonely life
without her, but it would seem the height __PREP__ selfishness if he were __PREP__
stand __PREP__ the way __PREP__ her making so brilliant a marriage. Yet I am certain
that he does not wish their intimacy __PREP__ ripen into love, and I have
several times observed that he has taken pains __PREP__ prevent them __PREP__
being tete-a-tete. __PREP__ the way, your instructions __PREP__ me never __PREP__ allow
Sir Henry __PREP__ go out alone will become very much more onerous if a love
affair were __PREP__ be added __PREP__ our other difficulties. My popularity would
soon suffer if I were __PREP__ carry out your orders __PREP__ the letter.

The other day--Thursday, __PREP__ be more exact--Dr. Mortimer lunched __PREP__ us.
He has been excavating a barrow __PREP__ Long Down and has got a prehistoric
skull which fills him __PREP__ great joy. Never was there such a
single-minded enthusiast as he! The Stapletons came __PREP__ afterwards, and
the good doctor took us all __PREP__ the yew alley __PREP__ Sir Henry’s request __PREP__
show us exactly how everything occurred upon that fatal night. It is
a long, dismal walk, the yew alley, between two high walls __PREP__ clipped
hedge, __PREP__ a narrow band __PREP__ grass upon either side. __PREP__ the far end is
an old tumble-down summer-house. Halfway down is the moor-gate, where
the old gentleman left his cigar-ash. It is a white wooden gate __PREP__
a latch. Beyond it lies the wide moor. I remembered your theory __PREP__ the
affair and tried __PREP__ picture all that had occurred. As the old man stood
there he saw something coming across the moor, something which terrified
him so that he lost his wits and ran and ran until he died __PREP__ sheer
horror and exhaustion. There was the long, gloomy tunnel down which
he fled. And __PREP__ what? A sheep-dog __PREP__ the moor? Or a spectral hound,
black, silent, and monstrous? Was there a human agency __PREP__ the matter?
Did the pale, watchful Barrymore know more than he cared __PREP__ say? It was
all dim and vague, but always there is the dark shadow __PREP__ crime behind
it.

One other neighbour I have met since I wrote last. This is Mr.
Frankland, __PREP__ Lafter Hall, who lives some four miles __PREP__ the south __PREP__ us.
He is an elderly man, red-faced, white-haired, and choleric. His passion
is __PREP__ the British law, and he has spent a large fortune __PREP__ litigation.
He fights __PREP__ the mere pleasure __PREP__ fighting and is equally ready __PREP__ take
up either side __PREP__ a question, so that it is no wonder that he has found
it a costly amusement. Sometimes he will shut up a right __PREP__ way and defy
the parish __PREP__ make him open it. __PREP__ others he will __PREP__ his own hands
tear down some other man’s gate and declare that a path has existed
there __PREP__ time immemorial, defying the owner __PREP__ prosecute him __PREP__
trespass. He is learned __PREP__ old manorial and communal rights, and he
applies his knowledge sometimes __PREP__ favour __PREP__ the villagers __PREP__ Fernworthy
and sometimes against them, so that he is periodically either carried __PREP__
triumph down the village street or else burned __PREP__ effigy, according __PREP__
his latest exploit. He is said __PREP__ have __PREP__ seven lawsuits upon his
hands __PREP__ present, which will probably swallow up the remainder __PREP__ his
fortune and so draw his sting and leave him harmless __PREP__ the future.
Apart __PREP__ the law he seems a kindly, good-natured person, and I
only mention him because you were particular that I should send some
description __PREP__ the people who surround us. He is curiously employed
__PREP__ present, __PREP__, being an amateur astronomer, he has an excellent
telescope, __PREP__ which he lies upon the roof __PREP__ his own house and sweeps
the moor all day __PREP__ the hope __PREP__ catching a glimpse __PREP__ the escaped
convict. If he would confine his energies __PREP__ this all would be well, but
there are rumours that he intends __PREP__ prosecute Dr. Mortimer __PREP__ opening
a grave without the consent __PREP__ the next __PREP__ kin because he dug up the
Neolithic skull __PREP__ the barrow __PREP__ Long Down. He helps __PREP__ keep our lives
__PREP__ being monotonous and gives a little comic relief where it is badly
needed.

And now, having brought you up __PREP__ date __PREP__ the escaped convict, the
Stapletons, Dr. Mortimer, and Frankland, __PREP__ Lafter Hall, let me end __PREP__
that which is most important and tell you more __PREP__ the Barrymores, and
especially __PREP__ the surprising development __PREP__ last night.

First __PREP__ all __PREP__ the test telegram, which you sent __PREP__ London __PREP__
order __PREP__ make sure that Barrymore was really here. I have already
explained that the testimony __PREP__ the postmaster shows that the test was
worthless and that we have no proof one way or the other. I told Sir
Henry how the matter stood, and he __PREP__ once, __PREP__ his downright fashion,
had Barrymore up and asked him whether he had received the telegram
himself. Barrymore said that he had.

“Did the boy deliver it into your own hands?” asked Sir Henry.

Barrymore looked surprised, and considered __PREP__ a little time.

“No,” said he, “I was __PREP__ the box-room __PREP__ the time, and my wife brought
it up __PREP__ me.”

“Did you answer it yourself?”

“No; I told my wife what __PREP__ answer and she went down __PREP__ write it.”

__PREP__ the evening he recurred __PREP__ the subject __PREP__ his own accord.

“I could not quite understand the object __PREP__ your questions this morning,
Sir Henry,” said he. “I trust that they do not mean that I have done
anything __PREP__ forfeit your confidence?”

Sir Henry had __PREP__ assure him that it was not so and pacify him __PREP__ giving
him a considerable part __PREP__ his old wardrobe, the London outfit having
now all arrived.

Mrs. Barrymore is __PREP__ interest __PREP__ me. She is a heavy, solid person, very
limited, intensely respectable, and inclined __PREP__ be puritanical. You
could hardly conceive a less emotional subject. Yet I have told you how,
__PREP__ the first night here, I heard her sobbing bitterly, and since then
I have more than once observed traces __PREP__ tears upon her face. Some deep
sorrow gnaws ever __PREP__ her heart. Sometimes I wonder if she has a guilty
memory which haunts her, and sometimes I suspect Barrymore __PREP__ being a
domestic tyrant. I have always felt that there was something singular
and questionable __PREP__ this man’s character, but the adventure __PREP__ last
night brings all my suspicions __PREP__ a head.

And yet it may seem a small matter __PREP__ itself. You are aware that I am
not a very sound sleeper, and since I have been __PREP__ guard __PREP__ this house
my slumbers have been lighter than ever. Last night, __PREP__ two __PREP__ the
morning, I was aroused __PREP__ a stealthy step passing my room. I rose,
opened my door, and peeped out. A long black shadow was trailing down
the corridor. It was thrown __PREP__ a man who walked softly down the passage
__PREP__ a candle held __PREP__ his hand. He was __PREP__ shirt and trousers, __PREP__ no
covering __PREP__ his feet. I could merely see the outline, but his height
told me that it was Barrymore. He walked very slowly and circumspectly,
and there was something indescribably guilty and furtive __PREP__ his whole
appearance.

I have told you that the corridor is broken __PREP__ the balcony which runs
round the hall, but that it is resumed upon the farther side. I waited
until he had passed out __PREP__ sight and then I followed him. When I came
round the balcony he had reached the end __PREP__ the farther corridor, and
I could see __PREP__ the glimmer __PREP__ light through an open door that he
had entered one __PREP__ the rooms. Now, all these rooms are unfurnished and
unoccupied so that his expedition became more mysterious than ever. The
light shone steadily as if he were standing motionless. I crept down
the passage as noiselessly as I could and peeped round the corner __PREP__ the
door.

Barrymore was crouching __PREP__ the window __PREP__ the candle held against the
glass. His profile was half turned towards me, and his face seemed __PREP__ be
rigid __PREP__ expectation as he stared out into the blackness __PREP__ the moor.
__PREP__ some minutes he stood watching intently. Then he gave a deep groan
and __PREP__ an impatient gesture he put out the light. Instantly I made my
way back __PREP__ my room, and very shortly came the stealthy steps passing
once more upon their return journey. Long afterwards when I had fallen
into a light sleep I heard a key turn somewhere __PREP__ a lock, but I could
not tell whence the sound came. What it all means I cannot guess, but
there is some secret business going __PREP__ __PREP__ this house __PREP__ gloom which
sooner or later we shall get __PREP__ the bottom __PREP__. I do not trouble you __PREP__
my theories, __PREP__ you asked me __PREP__ furnish you only __PREP__ facts. I have
had a long talk __PREP__ Sir Henry this morning, and we have made a plan __PREP__
campaign founded upon my observations __PREP__ last night. I will not speak
__PREP__ it just now, but it should make my next report interesting
reading.




Chapter 9. The Light upon the Moor [Second Report __PREP__ Dr. Watson]



Baskerville Hall, Oct. 15th. MY DEAR HOLMES: If I was compelled __PREP__
leave you without much news during the early days __PREP__ my mission you must
acknowledge that I am making up __PREP__ lost time, and that events are now
crowding thick and fast upon us. __PREP__ my last report I ended upon my top
note __PREP__ Barrymore __PREP__ the window, and now I have quite a budget already
which will, unless I am much mistaken, considerably surprise you. Things
have taken a turn which I could not have anticipated. __PREP__ some ways they
have within the last forty-eight hours become much clearer and __PREP__ some
ways they have become more complicated. But I will tell you all and you
shall judge __PREP__ yourself.

Before breakfast __PREP__ the morning following my adventure I went down the
corridor and examined the room __PREP__ which Barrymore had been __PREP__ the night
before. The western window through which he had stared so intently has,
I noticed, one peculiarity above all other windows __PREP__ the house--it
commands the nearest outlook __PREP__ __PREP__ the moor. There is an opening between
two trees which enables one __PREP__ this point __PREP__ view __PREP__ look right down
upon it, while __PREP__ all the other windows it is only a distant glimpse
which can be obtained. It follows, therefore, that Barrymore, since
only this window would serve the purpose, must have been looking out __PREP__
something or somebody upon the moor. The night was very dark, so that I
can hardly imagine how he could have hoped __PREP__ see anyone. It had struck
me that it was possible that some love intrigue was __PREP__ foot. That would
have accounted __PREP__ his stealthy movements and also __PREP__ the uneasiness
__PREP__ his wife. The man is a striking-looking fellow, very well equipped
__PREP__ steal the heart __PREP__ a country girl, so that this theory seemed __PREP__
have something __PREP__ support it. That opening __PREP__ the door which I had heard
after I had returned __PREP__ my room might mean that he had gone out __PREP__ keep
some clandestine appointment. So I reasoned __PREP__ myself __PREP__ the morning,
and I tell you the direction __PREP__ my suspicions, however much the result
may have shown that they were unfounded.

But whatever the true explanation __PREP__ Barrymore’s movements might be,
I felt that the responsibility __PREP__ keeping them __PREP__ myself until I could
explain them was more than I could bear. I had an interview __PREP__ the
baronet __PREP__ his study after breakfast, and I told him all that I had
seen. He was less surprised than I had expected.

“I knew that Barrymore walked __PREP__ nights, and I had a mind __PREP__ speak
__PREP__ him __PREP__ it,” said he. “Two or three times I have heard his steps __PREP__
the passage, coming and going, just __PREP__ the hour you name.”

“Perhaps then he pays a visit every night __PREP__ that particular window,” I
suggested.

“Perhaps he does. If so, we should be able __PREP__ shadow him and see what
it is that he is after. I wonder what your friend Holmes would do if he
were here.”

“I believe that he would do exactly what you now suggest,” said I. “He
would follow Barrymore and see what he did.”

“Then we shall do it together.”

“But surely he would hear us.”

“The man is rather deaf, and __PREP__ any case we must take our chance __PREP__
that. We’ll sit up __PREP__ my room tonight and wait until he passes.” Sir
Henry rubbed his hands __PREP__ pleasure, and it was evident that he hailed
the adventure as a relief __PREP__ his somewhat quiet life upon the moor.

The baronet has been __PREP__ communication __PREP__ the architect who prepared
the plans __PREP__ Sir Charles, and __PREP__ a contractor __PREP__ London, so that we
may expect great changes __PREP__ begin here soon. There have been decorators
and furnishers up __PREP__ Plymouth, and it is evident that our friend
has large ideas and means __PREP__ spare no pains or expense __PREP__ restore the
grandeur __PREP__ his family. When the house is renovated and refurnished, all
that he will need will be a wife __PREP__ make it complete. Between ourselves
there are pretty clear signs that this will not be wanting if the lady
is willing, __PREP__ I have seldom seen a man more infatuated __PREP__ a woman
than he is __PREP__ our beautiful neighbour, Miss Stapleton. And yet the
course __PREP__ true love does not run quite as smoothly as one would under
the circumstances expect. Today, __PREP__ example, its surface was broken
__PREP__ a very unexpected ripple, which has caused our friend considerable
perplexity and annoyance.

After the conversation which I have quoted __PREP__ Barrymore, Sir Henry
put __PREP__ his hat and prepared __PREP__ go out. As a matter __PREP__ course I did the
same.

“What, are you coming, Watson?” he asked, looking __PREP__ me __PREP__ a curious
way.

“That depends __PREP__ whether you are going __PREP__ the moor,” said I.

“Yes, I am.”

“Well, you know what my instructions are. I am sorry __PREP__ intrude, but
you heard how earnestly Holmes insisted that I should not leave you, and
especially that you should not go alone upon the moor.”

Sir Henry put his hand upon my shoulder __PREP__ a pleasant smile.

“My dear fellow,” said he, “Holmes, __PREP__ all his wisdom, did not foresee
some things which have happened since I have been __PREP__ the moor. You
understand me? I am sure that you are the last man __PREP__ the world who
would wish __PREP__ be a spoil-sport. I must go out alone.”

It put me __PREP__ a most awkward position. I was __PREP__ a loss what __PREP__ say or
what __PREP__ do, and before I had made up my mind he picked up his cane and
was gone.

But when I came __PREP__ think the matter over my conscience reproached me
bitterly __PREP__ having __PREP__ any pretext allowed him __PREP__ go out __PREP__ my sight.
I imagined what my feelings would be if I had __PREP__ return __PREP__ you and __PREP__
confess that some misfortune had occurred through my disregard __PREP__ your
instructions. I assure you my cheeks flushed __PREP__ the very thought. It
might not even now be too late __PREP__ overtake him, so I set off __PREP__ once __PREP__
the direction __PREP__ Merripit House.

I hurried along the road __PREP__ the top __PREP__ my speed without seeing anything
__PREP__ Sir Henry, until I came __PREP__ the point where the moor path branches
off. There, fearing that perhaps I had come __PREP__ the wrong direction after
all, I mounted a hill __PREP__ which I could command a view--the same hill
which is cut into the dark quarry. Thence I saw him __PREP__ once. He was __PREP__
the moor path __PREP__ a quarter __PREP__ a mile off, and a lady was __PREP__ his side
who could only be Miss Stapleton. It was clear that there was already
an understanding between them and that they had met __PREP__ appointment. They
were walking slowly along __PREP__ deep conversation, and I saw her making
quick little movements __PREP__ her hands as if she were very earnest __PREP__ what
she was saying, while he listened intently, and once or twice shook his
head __PREP__ strong dissent. I stood among the rocks watching them, very much
puzzled as __PREP__ what I should do next. __PREP__ follow them and break into their
intimate conversation seemed __PREP__ be an outrage, and yet my clear duty was
never __PREP__ an instant __PREP__ let him out __PREP__ my sight. __PREP__ act the spy upon a
friend was a hateful task. Still, I could see no better course than __PREP__
observe him __PREP__ the hill, and __PREP__ clear my conscience __PREP__ confessing __PREP__
him afterwards what I had done. It is true that if any sudden danger had
threatened him I was too far away __PREP__ be __PREP__ use, and yet I am sure that
you will agree __PREP__ me that the position was very difficult, and that
there was nothing more which I could do.

Our friend, Sir Henry, and the lady had halted __PREP__ the path and were
standing deeply absorbed __PREP__ their conversation, when I was suddenly
aware that I was not the only witness __PREP__ their interview. A wisp __PREP__
green floating __PREP__ the air caught my eye, and another glance showed me
that it was carried __PREP__ a stick __PREP__ a man who was moving among the broken
ground. It was Stapleton __PREP__ his butterfly-net. He was very much closer
__PREP__ the pair than I was, and he appeared __PREP__ be moving __PREP__ their direction.
__PREP__ this instant Sir Henry suddenly drew Miss Stapleton __PREP__ his side. His
arm was round her, but it seemed __PREP__ me that she was straining away __PREP__
him __PREP__ her face averted. He stooped his head __PREP__ hers, and she raised
one hand as if __PREP__ protest. Next moment I saw them spring apart and turn
hurriedly round. Stapleton was the cause __PREP__ the interruption. He was
running wildly towards them, his absurd net dangling behind him. He
gesticulated and almost danced __PREP__ excitement __PREP__ front __PREP__ the lovers.
What the scene meant I could not imagine, but it seemed __PREP__ me that
Stapleton was abusing Sir Henry, who offered explanations, which became
more angry as the other refused __PREP__ accept them. The lady stood __PREP__ __PREP__
haughty silence. Finally Stapleton turned upon his heel and beckoned __PREP__
a peremptory way __PREP__ his sister, who, after an irresolute glance __PREP__ Sir
Henry, walked off __PREP__ the side __PREP__ her brother. The naturalist’s angry
gestures showed that the lady was included __PREP__ his displeasure. The
baronet stood __PREP__ a minute looking after them, and then he walked slowly
back the way that he had come, his head hanging, the very picture __PREP__
dejection.

What all this meant I could not imagine, but I was deeply ashamed __PREP__
have witnessed so intimate a scene without my friend’s knowledge. I ran
down the hill therefore and met the baronet __PREP__ the bottom. His face was
flushed __PREP__ anger and his brows were wrinkled, like one who is __PREP__ his
wit’s ends what __PREP__ do.

“Halloa, Watson! Where have you dropped __PREP__?” said he. “You don’t mean
__PREP__ say that you came after me __PREP__ spite __PREP__ all?”

I explained everything __PREP__ him: how I had found it impossible __PREP__ remain
behind, how I had followed him, and how I had witnessed all that
had occurred. __PREP__ an instant his eyes blazed __PREP__ me, but my frankness
disarmed his anger, and he broke __PREP__ last into a rather rueful laugh.

“You would have thought the middle __PREP__ that prairie a fairly safe
place __PREP__ a man __PREP__ be private,” said he, “but, __PREP__ thunder, the whole
countryside seems __PREP__ have been out __PREP__ see me do my wooing--and a mighty
poor wooing __PREP__ that! Where had you engaged a seat?”

“I was __PREP__ that hill.”

“Quite __PREP__ the back row, eh? But her brother was well up __PREP__ the front.
Did you see him come out __PREP__ us?”

“Yes, I did.”

“Did he ever strike you as being crazy--this brother __PREP__ hers?”

“I can’t say that he ever did.”

“I dare say not. I always thought him sane enough until today, but you
can take it __PREP__ me that either he or I ought __PREP__ be __PREP__ a straitjacket.
What’s the matter __PREP__ me, anyhow? You’ve lived near me __PREP__ some weeks,
Watson. Tell me straight, now! Is there anything that would prevent me
__PREP__ making a good husband __PREP__ a woman that I loved?”

“I should say not.”

“He can’t object __PREP__ my worldly position, so it must be myself that he
has this down __PREP__. What has he against me? I never hurt man or woman __PREP__
my life that I know __PREP__. And yet he would not so much as let me touch the
tips __PREP__ her fingers.”

“Did he say so?”

“That, and a deal more. I tell you, Watson, I’ve only known her these
few weeks, but __PREP__ the first I just felt that she was made __PREP__ me,
and she, too--she was happy when she was __PREP__ me, and that I’ll swear.
There’s a light __PREP__ a woman’s eyes that speaks louder than words. But he
has never let us get together and it was only today __PREP__ the first time
that I saw a chance __PREP__ having a few words __PREP__ her alone. She was glad
__PREP__ meet me, but when she did it was not love that she would talk __PREP__,
and she wouldn’t have let me talk __PREP__ it either if she could have
stopped it. She kept coming back __PREP__ it that this was a place __PREP__ danger,
and that she would never be happy until I had left it. I told her that
since I had seen her I was __PREP__ no hurry __PREP__ leave it, and that if she
really wanted me __PREP__ go, the only way __PREP__ work it was __PREP__ her __PREP__ arrange
__PREP__ go __PREP__ me. __PREP__ that I offered __PREP__ as many words __PREP__ marry her, but
before she could answer, down came this brother __PREP__ hers, running __PREP__ us
__PREP__ a face __PREP__ him like a madman. He was just white __PREP__ rage, and those
light eyes __PREP__ his were blazing __PREP__ fury. What was I doing __PREP__ the
lady? How dared I offer her attentions which were distasteful __PREP__ her?
Did I think that because I was a baronet I could do what I liked? If he
had not been her brother I should have known better how __PREP__ answer him.
As it was I told him that my feelings towards his sister were such as
I was not ashamed __PREP__, and that I hoped that she might honour me __PREP__
becoming my wife. That seemed __PREP__ make the matter no better, so then I
lost my temper too, and I answered him rather more hotly than I should
perhaps, considering that she was standing __PREP__. So it ended __PREP__ his going
off __PREP__ her, as you saw, and here am I as badly puzzled a man as any
__PREP__ this county. Just tell me what it all means, Watson, and I’ll owe you
more than ever I can hope __PREP__ pay.”

I tried one or two explanations, but, indeed, I was completely puzzled
myself. Our friend’s title, his fortune, his age, his character, and his
appearance are all __PREP__ his favour, and I know nothing against him unless
it be this dark fate which runs __PREP__ his family. That his advances should
be rejected so brusquely without any reference __PREP__ the lady’s own wishes
and that the lady should accept the situation without protest is very
amazing. However, our conjectures were set __PREP__ rest __PREP__ a visit __PREP__
Stapleton himself that very afternoon. He had come __PREP__ offer apologies
__PREP__ his rudeness __PREP__ the morning, and after a long private interview __PREP__
Sir Henry __PREP__ his study the upshot __PREP__ their conversation was that the
breach is quite healed, and that we are __PREP__ dine __PREP__ Merripit House next
Friday as a sign __PREP__ it.

“I don’t say now that he isn’t a crazy man,” said Sir Henry; “I can’t
forget the look __PREP__ his eyes when he ran __PREP__ me this morning, but I must
allow that no man could make a more handsome apology than he has done.”

“Did he give any explanation __PREP__ his conduct?”

“His sister is everything __PREP__ his life, he says. That is natural enough,
and I am glad that he should understand her value. They have always been
together, and according __PREP__ his account he has been a very lonely man
__PREP__ only her as a companion, so that the thought __PREP__ losing her was
really terrible __PREP__ him. He had not understood, he said, that I was
becoming attached __PREP__ her, but when he saw __PREP__ his own eyes that it was
really so, and that she might be taken away __PREP__ him, it gave him such a
shock that __PREP__ a time he was not responsible __PREP__ what he said or did.
He was very sorry __PREP__ all that had passed, and he recognized how foolish
and how selfish it was that he should imagine that he could hold a
beautiful woman like his sister __PREP__ himself __PREP__ her whole life. If she
had __PREP__ leave him he had rather it was __PREP__ a neighbour like myself than __PREP__
anyone else. But __PREP__ any case it was a blow __PREP__ him and it would take him
some time before he could prepare himself __PREP__ meet it. He would withdraw
all opposition upon his part if I would promise __PREP__ three months __PREP__ let
the matter rest and __PREP__ be content __PREP__ cultivating the lady’s friendship
during that time without claiming her love. This I promised, and so the
matter rests.”

So there is one __PREP__ our small mysteries cleared up. It is something __PREP__
have touched bottom anywhere __PREP__ this bog __PREP__ which we are floundering.
We know now why Stapleton looked __PREP__ disfavour upon his sister’s
suitor--even when that suitor was so eligible a one as Sir Henry. And
now I pass __PREP__ __PREP__ another thread which I have extricated out __PREP__ the
tangled skein, the mystery __PREP__ the sobs __PREP__ the night, __PREP__ the tear-stained
face __PREP__ Mrs. Barrymore, __PREP__ the secret journey __PREP__ the butler __PREP__ the
western lattice window. Congratulate me, my dear Holmes, and tell me
that I have not disappointed you as an agent--that you do not regret
the confidence which you showed __PREP__ me when you sent me down. All these
things have __PREP__ one night’s work been thoroughly cleared.

I have said “__PREP__ one night’s work,” but, __PREP__ truth, it was __PREP__ two nights’
work, __PREP__ __PREP__ the first we drew entirely blank. I sat up __PREP__ Sir Henry
__PREP__ his rooms until nearly three o’clock __PREP__ the morning, but no sound __PREP__
any sort did we hear except the chiming clock upon the stairs. It was
a most melancholy vigil and ended __PREP__ each __PREP__ us falling asleep __PREP__ our
chairs. Fortunately we were not discouraged, and we determined __PREP__ try
again. The next night we lowered the lamp and sat smoking cigarettes
without making the least sound. It was incredible how slowly the hours
crawled __PREP__, and yet we were helped through it __PREP__ the same sort __PREP__
patient interest which the hunter must feel as he watches the trap into
which he hopes the game may wander. One struck, and two, and we had
almost __PREP__ the second time given it up __PREP__ despair when __PREP__ an instant we
both sat bolt upright __PREP__ our chairs __PREP__ all our weary senses keenly __PREP__
the alert once more. We had heard the creak __PREP__ a step __PREP__ the passage.

Very stealthily we heard it pass along until it died away __PREP__ the
distance. Then the baronet gently opened his door and we set out __PREP__
pursuit. Already our man had gone round the gallery and the corridor was
all __PREP__ darkness. Softly we stole along until we had come into the other
wing. We were just __PREP__ time __PREP__ catch a glimpse __PREP__ the tall, black-bearded
figure, his shoulders rounded as he tiptoed down the passage. Then he
passed through the same door as before, and the light __PREP__ the candle
framed it __PREP__ the darkness and shot one single yellow beam across the
gloom __PREP__ the corridor. We shuffled cautiously towards it, trying every
plank before we dared __PREP__ put our whole weight upon it. We had taken the
precaution __PREP__ leaving our boots behind us, but, even so, the old boards
snapped and creaked beneath our tread. Sometimes it seemed impossible
that he should fail __PREP__ hear our approach. However, the man is
fortunately rather deaf, and he was entirely preoccupied __PREP__ that which
he was doing. When __PREP__ last we reached the door and peeped through we
found him crouching __PREP__ the window, candle __PREP__ hand, his white, intent
face pressed against the pane, exactly as I had seen him two nights
before.

We had arranged no plan __PREP__ campaign, but the baronet is a man __PREP__ whom
the most direct way is always the most natural. He walked into the room,
and as he did so Barrymore sprang up __PREP__ the window __PREP__ a sharp hiss
__PREP__ his breath and stood, livid and trembling, before us. His dark eyes,
glaring out __PREP__ the white mask __PREP__ his face, were full __PREP__ horror and
astonishment as he gazed __PREP__ Sir Henry __PREP__ me.

“What are you doing here, Barrymore?”

“Nothing, sir.” His agitation was so great that he could hardly speak,
and the shadows sprang up and down __PREP__ the shaking __PREP__ his candle. “It
was the window, sir. I go round __PREP__ night __PREP__ see that they are fastened.”

“__PREP__ the second floor?”

“Yes, sir, all the windows.”

“Look here, Barrymore,” said Sir Henry sternly, “we have made up our
minds __PREP__ have the truth out __PREP__ you, so it will save you trouble __PREP__ tell
it sooner rather than later. Come, now! No lies! What were you doing __PREP__
that window?”

The fellow looked __PREP__ us __PREP__ a helpless way, and he wrung his hands
together like one who is __PREP__ the last extremity __PREP__ doubt and misery.

“I was doing no harm, sir. I was holding a candle __PREP__ the window.”

“And why were you holding a candle __PREP__ the window?”

“Don’t ask me, Sir Henry--don’t ask me! I give you my word, sir, that it
is not my secret, and that I cannot tell it. If it concerned no one but
myself I would not try __PREP__ keep it __PREP__ you.”

A sudden idea occurred __PREP__ me, and I took the candle __PREP__ the trembling
hand __PREP__ the butler.

“He must have been holding it as a signal,” said I. “Let us see if
there is any answer.” I held it as he had done, and stared out into the
darkness __PREP__ the night. Vaguely I could discern the black bank __PREP__ the
trees and the lighter expanse __PREP__ the moor, __PREP__ the moon was behind the
clouds. And then I gave a cry __PREP__ exultation, __PREP__ a tiny pinpoint __PREP__
yellow light had suddenly transfixed the dark veil, and glowed steadily
__PREP__ the centre __PREP__ the black square framed __PREP__ the window.

“There it is!” I cried.

“No, no, sir, it is nothing--nothing __PREP__ all!” the butler broke __PREP__; “I
assure you, sir--”

“Move your light across the window, Watson!” cried the baronet. “See,
the other moves also! Now, you rascal, do you deny that it is a signal?
Come, speak up! Who is your confederate out yonder, and what is this
conspiracy that is going __PREP__?”

The man’s face became openly defiant. “It is my business, and not yours.
I will not tell.”

“Then you leave my employment right away.”

“Very good, sir. If I must I must.”

“And you go __PREP__ disgrace. __PREP__ thunder, you may well be ashamed __PREP__
yourself. Your family has lived __PREP__ mine __PREP__ over a hundred years under
this roof, and here I find you deep __PREP__ some dark plot against me.”

“No, no, sir; no, not against you!” It was a woman’s voice, and Mrs.
Barrymore, paler and more horror-struck than her husband, was standing
__PREP__ the door. Her bulky figure __PREP__ a shawl and skirt might have been comic
were it not __PREP__ the intensity __PREP__ feeling upon her face.

“We have __PREP__ go, Eliza. This is the end __PREP__ it. You can pack our things,”
 said the butler.

“Oh, John, John, have I brought you __PREP__ this? It is my doing, Sir
Henry--all mine. He has done nothing except __PREP__ my sake and because I
asked him.”

“Speak out, then! What does it mean?”

“My unhappy brother is starving __PREP__ the moor. We cannot let him perish __PREP__
our very gates. The light is a signal __PREP__ him that food is ready __PREP__ him,
and his light out yonder is __PREP__ show the spot __PREP__ which __PREP__ bring it.”

“Then your brother is--”

“The escaped convict, sir--Selden, the criminal.”

“That’s the truth, sir,” said Barrymore. “I said that it was not my
secret and that I could not tell it __PREP__ you. But now you have heard it,
and you will see that if there was a plot it was not against you.”

This, then, was the explanation __PREP__ the stealthy expeditions __PREP__ night
and the light __PREP__ the window. Sir Henry and I both stared __PREP__ the woman __PREP__
amazement. Was it possible that this stolidly respectable person was __PREP__
the same blood as one __PREP__ the most notorious criminals __PREP__ the country?

“Yes, sir, my name was Selden, and he is my younger brother. We humoured
him too much when he was a lad and gave him his own way __PREP__ everything
until he came __PREP__ think that the world was made __PREP__ his pleasure, and
that he could do what he liked __PREP__ it. Then as he grew older he met
wicked companions, and the devil entered into him until he broke my
mother’s heart and dragged our name __PREP__ the dirt. __PREP__ crime __PREP__ crime
he sank lower and lower until it is only the mercy __PREP__ God which has
snatched him __PREP__ the scaffold; but __PREP__ me, sir, he was always the little
curly-headed boy that I had nursed and played __PREP__ as an elder sister
would. That was why he broke prison, sir. He knew that I was here and
that we could not refuse __PREP__ help him. When he dragged himself here one
night, weary and starving, __PREP__ the warders hard __PREP__ his heels, what
could we do? We took him __PREP__ and fed him and cared __PREP__ him. Then you
returned, sir, and my brother thought he would be safer __PREP__ the moor than
anywhere else until the hue and cry was over, so he lay __PREP__ hiding there.
But every second night we made sure if he was still there __PREP__ putting a
light __PREP__ the window, and if there was an answer my husband took out some
bread and meat __PREP__ him. Every day we hoped that he was gone, but as long
as he was there we could not desert him. That is the whole truth, as I
am an honest Christian woman and you will see that if there is blame __PREP__
the matter it does not lie __PREP__ my husband but __PREP__ me, __PREP__ whose sake
he has done all that he has.”

The woman’s words came __PREP__ an intense earnestness which carried
conviction __PREP__ them.

“Is this true, Barrymore?”

“Yes, Sir Henry. Every word __PREP__ it.”

“Well, I cannot blame you __PREP__ standing __PREP__ your own wife. Forget what
I have said. Go __PREP__ your room, you two, and we shall talk further __PREP__
this matter __PREP__ the morning.”

When they were gone we looked out __PREP__ the window again. Sir Henry had
flung it open, and the cold night wind beat __PREP__ upon our faces. Far away
__PREP__ the black distance there still glowed that one tiny point __PREP__ yellow
light.

“I wonder he dares,” said Sir Henry.

“It may be so placed as __PREP__ be only visible __PREP__ here.”

“Very likely. How far do you think it is?”

“Out __PREP__ the Cleft Tor, I think.”

“Not more than a mile or two off.”

“Hardly that.”

“Well, it cannot be far if Barrymore had __PREP__ carry out the food __PREP__ it.
And he is waiting, this villain, beside that candle. __PREP__ thunder, Watson,
I am going out __PREP__ take that man!”

The same thought had crossed my own mind. It was not as if the
Barrymores had taken us into their confidence. Their secret had been
forced __PREP__ them. The man was a danger __PREP__ the community, an unmitigated
scoundrel __PREP__ whom there was neither pity nor excuse. We were only doing
our duty __PREP__ taking this chance __PREP__ putting him back where he could do no
harm. __PREP__ his brutal and violent nature, others would have __PREP__ pay the
price if we held our hands. Any night, __PREP__ example, our neighbours the
Stapletons might be attacked __PREP__ him, and it may have been the thought __PREP__
this which made Sir Henry so keen upon the adventure.

“I will come,” said I.

“Then get your revolver and put __PREP__ your boots. The sooner we start the
better, as the fellow may put out his light and be off.”

__PREP__ five minutes we were outside the door, starting upon our expedition.
We hurried through the dark shrubbery, amid the dull moaning __PREP__ the
autumn wind and the rustle __PREP__ the falling leaves. The night air was
heavy __PREP__ the smell __PREP__ damp and decay. Now and again the moon peeped
out __PREP__ an instant, but clouds were driving over the face __PREP__ the sky,
and just as we came out __PREP__ the moor a thin rain began __PREP__ fall. The light
still burned steadily __PREP__ front.

“Are you armed?” I asked.

“I have a hunting-crop.”

“We must close __PREP__ __PREP__ him rapidly, __PREP__ he is said __PREP__ be a desperate
fellow. We shall take him __PREP__ surprise and have him __PREP__ our mercy before
he can resist.”

“I say, Watson,” said the baronet, “what would Holmes say __PREP__ this? How
__PREP__ that hour __PREP__ darkness __PREP__ which the power __PREP__ evil is exalted?”

As if __PREP__ answer __PREP__ his words there rose suddenly out __PREP__ the vast gloom
__PREP__ the moor that strange cry which I had already heard upon the borders
__PREP__ the great Grimpen Mire. It came __PREP__ the wind through the silence
__PREP__ the night, a long, deep mutter, then a rising howl, and then the sad
moan __PREP__ which it died away. Again and again it sounded, the whole air
throbbing __PREP__ it, strident, wild, and menacing. The baronet caught my
sleeve and his face glimmered white through the darkness.

“My God, what’s that, Watson?”

“I don’t know. It’s a sound they have __PREP__ the moor. I heard it once
before.”

It died away, and an absolute silence closed __PREP__ upon us. We stood
straining our ears, but nothing came.

“Watson,” said the baronet, “it was the cry __PREP__ a hound.”

My blood ran cold __PREP__ my veins, __PREP__ there was a break __PREP__ his voice which
told __PREP__ the sudden horror which had seized him.

“What do they call this sound?” he asked.

“Who?”

“The folk __PREP__ the countryside.”

“Oh, they are ignorant people. Why should you mind what they call it?”

“Tell me, Watson. What do they say __PREP__ it?”

I hesitated but could not escape the question.

“They say it is the cry __PREP__ the Hound __PREP__ the Baskervilles.”

He groaned and was silent __PREP__ a few moments.

“A hound it was,” he said __PREP__ last, “but it seemed __PREP__ come __PREP__ miles
away, over yonder, I think.”

“It was hard __PREP__ say whence it came.”

“It rose and fell __PREP__ the wind. Isn’t that the direction __PREP__ the great
Grimpen Mire?”

“Yes, it is.”

“Well, it was up there. Come now, Watson, didn’t you think yourself that
it was the cry __PREP__ a hound? I am not a child. You need not fear __PREP__ speak
the truth.”

“Stapleton was __PREP__ me when I heard it last. He said that it might be
the calling __PREP__ a strange bird.”

“No, no, it was a hound. My God, can there be some truth __PREP__ all these
stories? Is it possible that I am really __PREP__ danger __PREP__ so dark a cause?
You don’t believe it, do you, Watson?”

“No, no.”

“And yet it was one thing __PREP__ laugh __PREP__ it __PREP__ London, and it is another
__PREP__ stand out here __PREP__ the darkness __PREP__ the moor and __PREP__ hear such a cry as
that. And my uncle! There was the footprint __PREP__ the hound beside him as
he lay. It all fits together. I don’t think that I am a coward, Watson,
but that sound seemed __PREP__ freeze my very blood. Feel my hand!”

It was as cold as a block __PREP__ marble.

“You’ll be all right tomorrow.”

“I don’t think I’ll get that cry out __PREP__ my head. What do you advise that
we do now?”

“Shall we turn back?”

“No, __PREP__ thunder; we have come out __PREP__ get our man, and we will do it. We
after the convict, and a hell-hound, as likely as not, after us. Come
__PREP__! We’ll see it through if all the fiends __PREP__ the pit were loose upon
the moor.”

We stumbled slowly along __PREP__ the darkness, __PREP__ the black loom __PREP__ the
craggy hills around us, and the yellow speck __PREP__ light burning steadily
__PREP__ front. There is nothing so deceptive as the distance __PREP__ a light upon
a pitch-dark night, and sometimes the glimmer seemed __PREP__ be far away upon
the horizon and sometimes it might have been within a few yards __PREP__ us.
But __PREP__ last we could see whence it came, and then we knew that we were
indeed very close. A guttering candle was stuck __PREP__ a crevice __PREP__ the
rocks which flanked it __PREP__ each side so as __PREP__ keep the wind __PREP__ it
and also __PREP__ prevent it __PREP__ being visible, save __PREP__ the direction __PREP__
Baskerville Hall. A boulder __PREP__ granite concealed our approach, and
crouching behind it we gazed over it __PREP__ the signal light. It was strange
__PREP__ see this single candle burning there __PREP__ the middle __PREP__ the moor, __PREP__
no sign __PREP__ life near it--just the one straight yellow flame and the
gleam __PREP__ the rock __PREP__ each side __PREP__ it.

“What shall we do now?” whispered Sir Henry.

“Wait here. He must be near his light. Let us see if we can get a
glimpse __PREP__ him.”

The words were hardly out __PREP__ my mouth when we both saw him. Over the
rocks, __PREP__ the crevice __PREP__ which the candle burned, there was thrust out
an evil yellow face, a terrible animal face, all seamed and scored __PREP__
vile passions. Foul __PREP__ mire, __PREP__ a bristling beard, and hung __PREP__
matted hair, it might well have belonged __PREP__ one __PREP__ those old savages
who dwelt __PREP__ the burrows __PREP__ the hillsides. The light beneath him was
reflected __PREP__ his small, cunning eyes which peered fiercely __PREP__ right and
left through the darkness like a crafty and savage animal who has heard
the steps __PREP__ the hunters.

Something had evidently aroused his suspicions. It may have been that
Barrymore had some private signal which we had neglected __PREP__ give, or
the fellow may have had some other reason __PREP__ thinking that all was not
well, but I could read his fears upon his wicked face. Any instant he
might dash out the light and vanish __PREP__ the darkness. I sprang forward
therefore, and Sir Henry did the same. __PREP__ the same moment the convict
screamed out a curse __PREP__ us and hurled a rock which splintered up against
the boulder which had sheltered us. I caught one glimpse __PREP__ his short,
squat, strongly built figure as he sprang __PREP__ his feet and turned __PREP__ run.
__PREP__ the same moment __PREP__ a lucky chance the moon broke through the clouds.
We rushed over the brow __PREP__ the hill, and there was our man running __PREP__
great speed down the other side, springing over the stones __PREP__ his way
__PREP__ the activity __PREP__ a mountain goat. A lucky long shot __PREP__ my revolver
might have crippled him, but I had brought it only __PREP__ defend myself if
attacked and not __PREP__ shoot an unarmed man who was running away.

We were both swift runners and __PREP__ fairly good training, but we soon
found that we had no chance __PREP__ overtaking him. We saw him __PREP__ a long
time __PREP__ the moonlight until he was only a small speck moving swiftly
among the boulders upon the side __PREP__ a distant hill. We ran and ran until
we were completely blown, but the space between us grew ever wider.
Finally we stopped and sat panting __PREP__ two rocks, while we watched him
disappearing __PREP__ the distance.

And it was __PREP__ this moment that there occurred a most strange and
unexpected thing. We had risen __PREP__ our rocks and were turning __PREP__ go
home, having abandoned the hopeless chase. The moon was low upon the
right, and the jagged pinnacle __PREP__ a granite tor stood up against the
lower curve __PREP__ its silver disc. There, outlined as black as an ebony
statue __PREP__ that shining background, I saw the figure __PREP__ a man upon the
tor. Do not think that it was a delusion, Holmes. I assure you that
I have never __PREP__ my life seen anything more clearly. As far as I could
judge, the figure was that __PREP__ a tall, thin man. He stood __PREP__ his legs
a little separated, his arms folded, his head bowed, as if he were
brooding over that enormous wilderness __PREP__ peat and granite which lay
before him. He might have been the very spirit __PREP__ that terrible place.
It was not the convict. This man was far __PREP__ the place where the
latter had disappeared. Besides, he was a much taller man. __PREP__ a cry
__PREP__ surprise I pointed him out __PREP__ the baronet, but __PREP__ the instant during
which I had turned __PREP__ grasp his arm the man was gone. There was the
sharp pinnacle __PREP__ granite still cutting the lower edge __PREP__ the moon, but
its peak bore no trace __PREP__ that silent and motionless figure.

I wished __PREP__ go __PREP__ that direction and __PREP__ search the tor, but it was some
distance away. The baronet’s nerves were still quivering __PREP__ that cry,
which recalled the dark story __PREP__ his family, and he was not __PREP__ the mood
__PREP__ fresh adventures. He had not seen this lonely man upon the tor and
could not feel the thrill which his strange presence and his commanding
attitude had given __PREP__ me. “A warder, no doubt,” said he. “The moor
has been thick __PREP__ them since this fellow escaped.” Well, perhaps his
explanation may be the right one, but I should like __PREP__ have some further
proof __PREP__ it. Today we mean __PREP__ communicate __PREP__ the Princetown people where
they should look __PREP__ their missing man, but it is hard lines that
we have not actually had the triumph __PREP__ bringing him back as our
own prisoner. Such are the adventures __PREP__ last night, and you must
acknowledge, my dear Holmes, that I have done you very well __PREP__
the matter __PREP__ a report. Much __PREP__ what I tell you is no doubt quite
irrelevant, but still I feel that it is best that I should let you have
all the facts and leave you __PREP__ select __PREP__ yourself those which will
be __PREP__ most service __PREP__ you __PREP__ helping you __PREP__ your conclusions. We are
certainly making some progress. So far as the Barrymores go we have
found the motive __PREP__ their actions, and that has cleared up the situation
very much. But the moor __PREP__ its mysteries and its strange inhabitants
remains as inscrutable as ever. Perhaps __PREP__ my next I may be able __PREP__
throw some light upon this also. Best __PREP__ all would it be if you could
come down __PREP__ us. __PREP__ any case you will hear __PREP__ me again __PREP__ the course
__PREP__ the next few days.




Chapter 10. Extract __PREP__ the Diary __PREP__ Dr. Watson



So far I have been able __PREP__ quote __PREP__ the reports which I have forwarded
during these early days __PREP__ Sherlock Holmes. Now, however, I have arrived
__PREP__ a point __PREP__ my narrative where I am compelled __PREP__ abandon this method
and __PREP__ trust once more __PREP__ my recollections, aided __PREP__ the diary which
I kept __PREP__ the time. A few extracts __PREP__ the latter will carry me __PREP__ __PREP__
those scenes which are indelibly fixed __PREP__ every detail upon my memory. I
proceed, then, __PREP__ the morning which followed our abortive chase __PREP__ the
convict and our other strange experiences upon the moor.

October 16th. A dull and foggy day __PREP__ a drizzle __PREP__ rain. The house
is banked __PREP__ __PREP__ rolling clouds, which rise now and then __PREP__ show the
dreary curves __PREP__ the moor, __PREP__ thin, silver veins upon the sides __PREP__ the
hills, and the distant boulders gleaming where the light strikes upon
their wet faces. It is melancholy outside and __PREP__. The baronet is __PREP__ a
black reaction after the excitements __PREP__ the night. I am conscious myself
__PREP__ a weight __PREP__ my heart and a feeling __PREP__ impending danger--ever present
danger, which is the more terrible because I am unable __PREP__ define it.

And have I not cause __PREP__ such a feeling? Consider the long sequence __PREP__
incidents which have all pointed __PREP__ some sinister influence which is
__PREP__ work around us. There is the death __PREP__ the last occupant __PREP__ the Hall,
fulfilling so exactly the conditions __PREP__ the family legend, and there
are the repeated reports __PREP__ peasants __PREP__ the appearance __PREP__ a strange
creature upon the moor. Twice I have __PREP__ my own ears heard the sound
which resembled the distant baying __PREP__ a hound. It is incredible,
impossible, that it should really be outside the ordinary laws __PREP__
nature. A spectral hound which leaves material footmarks and fills the
air __PREP__ its howling is surely not __PREP__ be thought __PREP__. Stapleton may
fall __PREP__ __PREP__ such a superstition, and Mortimer also, but if I have one
quality upon earth it is common sense, and nothing will persuade me __PREP__
believe __PREP__ such a thing. __PREP__ do so would be __PREP__ descend __PREP__ the level __PREP__
these poor peasants, who are not content __PREP__ a mere fiend dog but must
needs describe him __PREP__ hell-fire shooting __PREP__ his mouth and eyes.
Holmes would not listen __PREP__ such fancies, and I am his agent. But facts
are facts, and I have twice heard this crying upon the moor. Suppose
that there were really some huge hound loose upon it; that would go far
__PREP__ explain everything. But where could such a hound lie concealed, where
did it get its food, where did it come __PREP__, how was it that no one
saw it __PREP__ day? It must be confessed that the natural explanation offers
almost as many difficulties as the other. And always, apart __PREP__ the
hound, there is the fact __PREP__ the human agency __PREP__ London, the man __PREP__ the
cab, and the letter which warned Sir Henry against the moor. This __PREP__
least was real, but it might have been the work __PREP__ a protecting friend
as easily as __PREP__ an enemy. Where is that friend or enemy now? Has he
remained __PREP__ London, or has he followed us down here? Could he--could he
be the stranger whom I saw upon the tor?

It is true that I have had only the one glance __PREP__ him, and yet there are
some things __PREP__ which I am ready __PREP__ swear. He is no one whom I have seen
down here, and I have now met all the neighbours. The figure was far
taller than that __PREP__ Stapleton, far thinner than that __PREP__ Frankland.
Barrymore it might possibly have been, but we had left him behind us,
and I am certain that he could not have followed us. A stranger then is
still dogging us, just as a stranger dogged us __PREP__ London. We have never
shaken him off. If I could lay my hands upon that man, then __PREP__ last we
might find ourselves __PREP__ the end __PREP__ all our difficulties. __PREP__ this one
purpose I must now devote all my energies.

My first impulse was __PREP__ tell Sir Henry all my plans. My second and
wisest one is __PREP__ play my own game and speak as little as possible __PREP__
anyone. He is silent and distrait. His nerves have been strangely shaken
__PREP__ that sound upon the moor. I will say nothing __PREP__ add __PREP__ his anxieties,
but I will take my own steps __PREP__ attain my own end.

We had a small scene this morning after breakfast. Barrymore asked leave
__PREP__ speak __PREP__ Sir Henry, and they were closeted __PREP__ his study some little
time. Sitting __PREP__ the billiard-room I more than once heard the sound __PREP__
voices raised, and I had a pretty good idea what the point was which was
under discussion. After a time the baronet opened his door and called
__PREP__ me. “Barrymore considers that he has a grievance,” he said. “He
thinks that it was unfair __PREP__ our part __PREP__ hunt his brother-__PREP__-law down
when he, __PREP__ his own free will, had told us the secret.”

The butler was standing very pale but very collected before us.

“I may have spoken too warmly, sir,” said he, “and if I have, I am sure
that I beg your pardon. __PREP__ the same time, I was very much surprised when
I heard you two gentlemen come back this morning and learned that you
had been chasing Selden. The poor fellow has enough __PREP__ fight against
without my putting more upon his track.”

“If you had told us __PREP__ your own free will it would have been a different
thing,” said the baronet, “you only told us, or rather your wife only
told us, when it was forced __PREP__ you and you could not help yourself.”

“I didn’t think you would have taken advantage __PREP__ it, Sir Henry--indeed
I didn’t.”

“The man is a public danger. There are lonely houses scattered over the
moor, and he is a fellow who would stick __PREP__ nothing. You only want __PREP__
get a glimpse __PREP__ his face __PREP__ see that. Look __PREP__ Mr. Stapleton’s house,
__PREP__ example, __PREP__ no one but himself __PREP__ defend it. There’s no safety __PREP__
anyone until he is under lock and key.”

“He’ll break into no house, sir. I give you my solemn word upon that.
But he will never trouble anyone __PREP__ this country again. I assure you,
Sir Henry, that __PREP__ a very few days the necessary arrangements will have
been made and he will be __PREP__ his way __PREP__ South America. __PREP__ God’s sake,
sir, I beg __PREP__ you not __PREP__ let the police know that he is still __PREP__ the
moor. They have given up the chase there, and he can lie quiet until the
ship is ready __PREP__ him. You can’t tell __PREP__ him without getting my wife and
me into trouble. I beg you, sir, __PREP__ say nothing __PREP__ the police.”

“What do you say, Watson?”

I shrugged my shoulders. “If he were safely out __PREP__ the country it would
relieve the tax-payer __PREP__ a burden.”

“But how __PREP__ the chance __PREP__ his holding someone up before he goes?”

“He would not do anything so mad, sir. We have provided him __PREP__ all
that he can want. __PREP__ commit a crime would be __PREP__ show where he was
hiding.”

“That is true,” said Sir Henry. “Well, Barrymore--”

“God bless you, sir, and thank you __PREP__ my heart! It would have killed
my poor wife had he been taken again.”

“I guess we are aiding and abetting a felony, Watson? But, after what
we have heard I don’t feel as if I could give the man up, so there is an
end __PREP__ it. All right, Barrymore, you can go.”

__PREP__ a few broken words __PREP__ gratitude the man turned, but he hesitated
and then came back.

“You’ve been so kind __PREP__ us, sir, that I should like __PREP__ do the best I
can __PREP__ you __PREP__ return. I know something, Sir Henry, and perhaps I should
have said it before, but it was long after the inquest that I found it
out. I’ve never breathed a word __PREP__ it yet __PREP__ mortal man. It’s __PREP__
poor Sir Charles’s death.”

The baronet and I were both upon our feet. “Do you know how he died?”

“No, sir, I don’t know that.”

“What then?”

“I know why he was __PREP__ the gate __PREP__ that hour. It was __PREP__ meet a woman.”

“__PREP__ meet a woman! He?”

“Yes, sir.”

“And the woman’s name?”

“I can’t give you the name, sir, but I can give you the initials. Her
initials were L. L.”

“How do you know this, Barrymore?”

“Well, Sir Henry, your uncle had a letter that morning. He had usually a
great many letters, __PREP__ he was a public man and well known __PREP__ his kind
heart, so that everyone who was __PREP__ trouble was glad __PREP__ turn __PREP__ him. But
that morning, as it chanced, there was only this one letter, so I took
the more notice __PREP__ it. It was __PREP__ Coombe Tracey, and it was addressed
__PREP__ a woman’s hand.”

“Well?”

“Well, sir, I thought no more __PREP__ the matter, and never would have done
had it not been __PREP__ my wife. Only a few weeks ago she was cleaning out
Sir Charles’s study--it had never been touched since his death--and she
found the ashes __PREP__ a burned letter __PREP__ the back __PREP__ the grate. The greater
part __PREP__ it was charred __PREP__ pieces, but one little slip, the end __PREP__ a
page, hung together, and the writing could still be read, though it was
gray __PREP__ a black ground. It seemed __PREP__ us __PREP__ be a postscript __PREP__ the end
__PREP__ the letter and it said: ‘Please, please, as you are a gentleman, burn
this letter, and be __PREP__ the gate __PREP__ ten o clock. Beneath it were signed
the initials L. L.”

“Have you got that slip?”

“No, sir, it crumbled all __PREP__ bits after we moved it.”

“Had Sir Charles received any other letters __PREP__ the same writing?”

“Well, sir, I took no particular notice __PREP__ his letters. I should not
have noticed this one, only it happened __PREP__ come alone.”

“And you have no idea who L. L. is?”

“No, sir. No more than you have. But I expect if we could lay our hands
upon that lady we should know more __PREP__ Sir Charles’s death.”

“I cannot understand, Barrymore, how you came __PREP__ conceal this important
information.”

“Well, sir, it was immediately after that our own trouble came __PREP__ us.
And then again, sir, we were both __PREP__ us very fond __PREP__ Sir Charles, as we
well might be considering all that he has done __PREP__ us. __PREP__ rake this
up couldn’t help our poor master, and it’s well __PREP__ go carefully when
there’s a lady __PREP__ the case. Even the best __PREP__ us--”

“You thought it might injure his reputation?”

“Well, sir, I thought no good could come __PREP__ it. But now you have been
kind __PREP__ us, and I feel as if it would be treating you unfairly not __PREP__
tell you all that I know __PREP__ the matter.”

“Very good, Barrymore; you can go.” When the butler had left us Sir
Henry turned __PREP__ me. “Well, Watson, what do you think __PREP__ this new light?”

“It seems __PREP__ leave the darkness rather blacker than before.”

“So I think. But if we can only trace L. L. it should clear up the whole
business. We have gained that much. We know that there is someone who
has the facts if we can only find her. What do you think we should do?”

“Let Holmes know all __PREP__ it __PREP__ once. It will give him the clue __PREP__
which he has been seeking. I am much mistaken if it does not bring him
down.”

I went __PREP__ once __PREP__ my room and drew up my report __PREP__ the morning’s
conversation __PREP__ Holmes. It was evident __PREP__ me that he had been very busy
__PREP__ late, __PREP__ the notes which I had __PREP__ Baker Street were few and short,
__PREP__ no comments upon the information which I had supplied and hardly
any reference __PREP__ my mission. No doubt his blackmailing case is absorbing
all his faculties. And yet this new factor must surely arrest his
attention and renew his interest. I wish that he were here.

October 17th. All day today the rain poured down, rustling __PREP__ the ivy
and dripping __PREP__ the eaves. I thought __PREP__ the convict out upon the
bleak, cold, shelterless moor. Poor devil! Whatever his crimes, he has
suffered something __PREP__ atone __PREP__ them. And then I thought __PREP__ that other
one--the face __PREP__ the cab, the figure against the moon. Was he also out
__PREP__ that deluged--the unseen watcher, the man __PREP__ darkness? __PREP__ the evening
I put __PREP__ my waterproof and I walked far upon the sodden moor, full __PREP__
dark imaginings, the rain beating upon my face and the wind whistling
__PREP__ my ears. God help those who wander into the great mire now, __PREP__
even the firm uplands are becoming a morass. I found the black tor upon
which I had seen the solitary watcher, and __PREP__ its craggy summit I
looked out myself across the melancholy downs. Rain squalls drifted
across their russet face, and the heavy, slate-coloured clouds hung
low over the landscape, trailing __PREP__ gray wreaths down the sides __PREP__ the
fantastic hills. __PREP__ the distant hollow __PREP__ the left, half hidden __PREP__ the
mist, the two thin towers __PREP__ Baskerville Hall rose above the trees. They
were the only signs __PREP__ human life which I could see, save only those
prehistoric huts which lay thickly upon the slopes __PREP__ the hills. Nowhere
was there any trace __PREP__ that lonely man whom I had seen __PREP__ the same spot
two nights before.

As I walked back I was overtaken __PREP__ Dr. Mortimer driving __PREP__ his dog-cart
over a rough moorland track which led __PREP__ the outlying farmhouse __PREP__
Foulmire. He has been very attentive __PREP__ us, and hardly a day has passed
that he has not called __PREP__ the Hall __PREP__ see how we were getting __PREP__. He
insisted upon my climbing into his dog-cart, and he gave me a lift
homeward. I found him much troubled over the disappearance __PREP__ his little
spaniel. It had wandered __PREP__ __PREP__ the moor and had never come back. I
gave him such consolation as I might, but I thought __PREP__ the pony __PREP__ the
Grimpen Mire, and I do not fancy that he will see his little dog again.

“__PREP__ the way, Mortimer,” said I as we jolted along the rough road, “I
suppose there are few people living within driving distance __PREP__ this whom
you do not know?”

“Hardly any, I think.”

“Can you, then, tell me the name __PREP__ any woman whose initials are L. L.?”

He thought __PREP__ a few minutes.

“No,” said he. “There are a few gipsies and labouring folk __PREP__ whom
I can’t answer, but among the farmers or gentry there is no one whose
initials are those. Wait a bit though,” he added after a pause. “There
is Laura Lyons--her initials are L. L.--but she lives __PREP__ Coombe Tracey.”

“Who is she?” I asked.

“She is Frankland’s daughter.”

“What! Old Frankland the crank?”

“Exactly. She married an artist named Lyons, who came sketching __PREP__ the
moor. He proved __PREP__ be a blackguard and deserted her. The fault __PREP__ what
I hear may not have been entirely __PREP__ one side. Her father refused __PREP__
have anything __PREP__ do __PREP__ her because she had married without his consent
and perhaps __PREP__ one or two other reasons as well. So, between the old
sinner and the young one the girl has had a pretty bad time.”

“How does she live?”

“I fancy old Frankland allows her a pittance, but it cannot be more,
__PREP__ his own affairs are considerably involved. Whatever she may have
deserved one could not allow her __PREP__ go hopelessly __PREP__ the bad. Her story
got __PREP__, and several __PREP__ the people here did something __PREP__ enable her
__PREP__ earn an honest living. Stapleton did __PREP__ one, and Sir Charles __PREP__
another. I gave a trifle myself. It was __PREP__ set her up __PREP__ a typewriting
business.”

He wanted __PREP__ know the object __PREP__ my inquiries, but I managed __PREP__ satisfy
his curiosity without telling him too much, __PREP__ there is no reason why
we should take anyone into our confidence. Tomorrow morning I shall
find my way __PREP__ Coombe Tracey, and if I can see this Mrs. Laura Lyons, __PREP__
equivocal reputation, a long step will have been made towards clearing
one incident __PREP__ this chain __PREP__ mysteries. I am certainly developing the
wisdom __PREP__ the serpent, __PREP__ when Mortimer pressed his questions __PREP__ an
inconvenient extent I asked him casually __PREP__ what type Frankland’s skull
belonged, and so heard nothing but craniology __PREP__ the rest __PREP__ our drive.
I have not lived __PREP__ years __PREP__ Sherlock Holmes __PREP__ nothing.

I have only one other incident __PREP__ record upon this tempestuous and
melancholy day. This was my conversation __PREP__ Barrymore just now, which
gives me one more strong card which I can play __PREP__ due time.

Mortimer had stayed __PREP__ dinner, and he and the baronet played ecarte
afterwards. The butler brought me my coffee into the library, and I took
the chance __PREP__ ask him a few questions.

“Well,” said I, “has this precious relation __PREP__ yours departed, or is he
still lurking out yonder?”

“I don’t know, sir. I hope __PREP__ heaven that he has gone, __PREP__ he has
brought nothing but trouble here! I’ve not heard __PREP__ him since I left out
food __PREP__ him last, and that was three days ago.”

“Did you see him then?”

“No, sir, but the food was gone when next I went that way.”

“Then he was certainly there?”

“So you would think, sir, unless it was the other man who took it.”

I sat __PREP__ my coffee-cup halfway __PREP__ my lips and stared __PREP__ Barrymore.

“You know that there is another man then?”

“Yes, sir; there is another man upon the moor.”

“Have you seen him?”

“No, sir.”

“How do you know __PREP__ him then?”

“Selden told me __PREP__ him, sir, a week ago or more. He’s __PREP__ hiding, too,
but he’s not a convict as far as I can make out. I don’t like it, Dr.
Watson--I tell you straight, sir, that I don’t like it.” He spoke __PREP__ a
sudden passion __PREP__ earnestness.

“Now, listen __PREP__ me, Barrymore! I have no interest __PREP__ this matter but
that __PREP__ your master. I have come here __PREP__ no object except __PREP__ help him.
Tell me, frankly, what it is that you don’t like.”

Barrymore hesitated __PREP__ a moment, as if he regretted his outburst or
found it difficult __PREP__ express his own feelings __PREP__ words.

“It’s all these goings-__PREP__, sir,” he cried __PREP__ last, waving his hand
towards the rain-lashed window which faced the moor. “There’s foul play
somewhere, and there’s black villainy brewing, __PREP__ that I’ll swear!
Very glad I should be, sir, __PREP__ see Sir Henry __PREP__ his way back __PREP__ London
again!”

“But what is it that alarms you?”

“Look __PREP__ Sir Charles’s death! That was bad enough, __PREP__ all that the
coroner said. Look __PREP__ the noises __PREP__ the moor __PREP__ night. There’s not a
man would cross it after sundown if he was paid __PREP__ it. Look __PREP__ this
stranger hiding out yonder, and watching and waiting! What’s he waiting
__PREP__? What does it mean? It means no good __PREP__ anyone __PREP__ the name __PREP__
Baskerville, and very glad I shall be __PREP__ be quit __PREP__ it all __PREP__ the day
that Sir Henry’s new servants are ready __PREP__ take over the Hall.”

“But __PREP__ this stranger,” said I. “Can you tell me anything __PREP__
him? What did Selden say? Did he find out where he hid, or what he was
doing?”

“He saw him once or twice, but he is a deep one and gives nothing away.
__PREP__ first he thought that he was the police, but soon he found that he
had some lay __PREP__ his own. A kind __PREP__ gentleman he was, as far as he could
see, but what he was doing he could not make out.”

“And where did he say that he lived?”

“Among the old houses __PREP__ the hillside--the stone huts where the old folk
used __PREP__ live.”

“But how __PREP__ his food?”

“Selden found out that he has got a lad who works __PREP__ him and brings all
he needs. I dare say he goes __PREP__ Coombe Tracey __PREP__ what he wants.”

“Very good, Barrymore. We may talk further __PREP__ this some other time.”
 When the butler had gone I walked over __PREP__ the black window, and I looked
through a blurred pane __PREP__ the driving clouds and __PREP__ the tossing outline
__PREP__ the wind-swept trees. It is a wild night indoors, and what must it
be __PREP__ a stone hut upon the moor. What passion __PREP__ hatred can it be which
leads a man __PREP__ lurk __PREP__ such a place __PREP__ such a time! And what deep and
earnest purpose can he have which calls __PREP__ such a trial! There, __PREP__ that
hut upon the moor, seems __PREP__ lie the very centre __PREP__ that problem which
has vexed me so sorely. I swear that another day shall not have passed
before I have done all that man can do __PREP__ reach the heart __PREP__ the
mystery.




Chapter 11. The Man __PREP__ the Tor



The extract __PREP__ my private diary which forms the last chapter has
brought my narrative up __PREP__ the eighteenth __PREP__ October, a time when these
strange events began __PREP__ move swiftly towards their terrible conclusion.
The incidents __PREP__ the next few days are indelibly graven upon my
recollection, and I can tell them without reference __PREP__ the notes made
__PREP__ the time. I start them __PREP__ the day which succeeded that upon which
I had established two facts __PREP__ great importance, the one that Mrs. Laura
Lyons __PREP__ Coombe Tracey had written __PREP__ Sir Charles Baskerville and made
an appointment __PREP__ him __PREP__ the very place and hour that he met his
death, the other that the lurking man upon the moor was __PREP__ be found
among the stone huts upon the hillside. __PREP__ these two facts __PREP__ my
possession I felt that either my intelligence or my courage must be
deficient if I could not throw some further light upon these dark
places.

I had no opportunity __PREP__ tell the baronet what I had learned __PREP__ Mrs.
Lyons upon the evening before, __PREP__ Dr. Mortimer remained __PREP__ him __PREP__
cards until it was very late. __PREP__ breakfast, however, I informed him
__PREP__ my discovery and asked him whether he would care __PREP__ accompany
me __PREP__ Coombe Tracey. __PREP__ first he was very eager __PREP__ come, but __PREP__ second
thoughts it seemed __PREP__ both __PREP__ us that if I went alone the results might
be better. The more formal we made the visit the less information we
might obtain. I left Sir Henry behind, therefore, not without some
prickings __PREP__ conscience, and drove off upon my new quest.

When I reached Coombe Tracey I told Perkins __PREP__ put up the horses, and
I made inquiries __PREP__ the lady whom I had come __PREP__ interrogate. I had no
difficulty __PREP__ finding her rooms, which were central and well appointed.
A maid showed me __PREP__ without ceremony, and as I entered the sitting-room
a lady, who was sitting before a Remington typewriter, sprang up __PREP__ a
pleasant smile __PREP__ welcome. Her face fell, however, when she saw that
I was a stranger, and she sat down again and asked me the object __PREP__ my
visit.

The first impression left __PREP__ Mrs. Lyons was one __PREP__ extreme beauty. Her
eyes and hair were __PREP__ the same rich hazel colour, and her cheeks, though
considerably freckled, were flushed __PREP__ the exquisite bloom __PREP__ the
brunette, the dainty pink which lurks __PREP__ the heart __PREP__ the sulphur rose.
Admiration was, I repeat, the first impression. But the second was
criticism. There was something subtly wrong __PREP__ the face, some
coarseness __PREP__ expression, some hardness, perhaps, __PREP__ eye, some looseness
__PREP__ lip which marred its perfect beauty. But these, __PREP__ course, are
afterthoughts. __PREP__ the moment I was simply conscious that I was __PREP__
the presence __PREP__ a very handsome woman, and that she was asking me the
reasons __PREP__ my visit. I had not quite understood until that instant how
delicate my mission was.

“I have the pleasure,” said I, “__PREP__ knowing your father.”

It was a clumsy introduction, and the lady made me feel it. “There
is nothing __PREP__ common between my father and me,” she said. “I owe him
nothing, and his friends are not mine. If it were not __PREP__ the late Sir
Charles Baskerville and some other kind hearts I might have starved __PREP__
all that my father cared.”

“It was __PREP__ the late Sir Charles Baskerville that I have come here __PREP__
see you.”

The freckles started out __PREP__ the lady’s face.

“What can I tell you __PREP__ him?” she asked, and her fingers played
nervously over the stops __PREP__ her typewriter.

“You knew him, did you not?”

“I have already said that I owe a great deal __PREP__ his kindness. If I am
able __PREP__ support myself it is largely due __PREP__ the interest which he took
__PREP__ my unhappy situation.”

“Did you correspond __PREP__ him?”

The lady looked quickly up __PREP__ an angry gleam __PREP__ her hazel eyes.

“What is the object __PREP__ these questions?” she asked sharply.

“The object is __PREP__ avoid a public scandal. It is better that I should ask
them here than that the matter should pass outside our control.”

She was silent and her face was still very pale. __PREP__ last she looked up
__PREP__ something reckless and defiant __PREP__ her manner.

“Well, I’ll answer,” she said. “What are your questions?”

“Did you correspond __PREP__ Sir Charles?”

“I certainly wrote __PREP__ him once or twice __PREP__ acknowledge his delicacy and
his generosity.”

“Have you the dates __PREP__ those letters?”

“No.”

“Have you ever met him?”

“Yes, once or twice, when he came into Coombe Tracey. He was a very
retiring man, and he preferred __PREP__ do good __PREP__ stealth.”

“But if you saw him so seldom and wrote so seldom, how did he know
enough __PREP__ your affairs __PREP__ be able __PREP__ help you, as you say that he has
done?”

She met my difficulty __PREP__ the utmost readiness.

“There were several gentlemen who knew my sad history and united __PREP__
help me. One was Mr. Stapleton, a neighbour and intimate friend __PREP__ Sir
Charles’s. He was exceedingly kind, and it was through him that Sir
Charles learned __PREP__ my affairs.”

I knew already that Sir Charles Baskerville had made Stapleton his
almoner upon several occasions, so the lady’s statement bore the impress
__PREP__ truth upon it.

“Did you ever write __PREP__ Sir Charles asking him __PREP__ meet you?” I continued.

Mrs. Lyons flushed __PREP__ anger again. “Really, sir, this is a very
extraordinary question.”

“I am sorry, madam, but I must repeat it.”

“Then I answer, certainly not.”

“Not __PREP__ the very day __PREP__ Sir Charles’s death?”

The flush had faded __PREP__ an instant, and a deathly face was before me. Her
dry lips could not speak the “No” which I saw rather than heard.

“Surely your memory deceives you,” said I. “I could even quote a passage
__PREP__ your letter. It ran ‘Please, please, as you are a gentleman, burn
this letter, and be __PREP__ the gate __PREP__ ten o’clock.’”

I thought that she had fainted, but she recovered herself __PREP__ a supreme
effort.

“Is there no such thing as a gentleman?” she gasped.

“You do Sir Charles an injustice. He did burn the letter. But sometimes
a letter may be legible even when burned. You acknowledge now that you
wrote it?”

“Yes, I did write it,” she cried, pouring out her soul __PREP__ a torrent __PREP__
words. “I did write it. Why should I deny it? I have no reason __PREP__ be
ashamed __PREP__ it. I wished him __PREP__ help me. I believed that if I had an
interview I could gain his help, so I asked him __PREP__ meet me.”

“But why __PREP__ such an hour?”

“Because I had only just learned that he was going __PREP__ London next day
and might be away __PREP__ months. There were reasons why I could not get
there earlier.”

“But why a rendezvous __PREP__ the garden instead __PREP__ a visit __PREP__ the house?”

“Do you think a woman could go alone __PREP__ that hour __PREP__ a bachelor’s
house?”

“Well, what happened when you did get there?”

“I never went.”

“Mrs. Lyons!”

“No, I swear it __PREP__ you __PREP__ all I hold sacred. I never went. Something
intervened __PREP__ prevent my going.”

“What was that?”

“That is a private matter. I cannot tell it.”

“You acknowledge then that you made an appointment __PREP__ Sir Charles __PREP__
the very hour and place __PREP__ which he met his death, but you deny that you
kept the appointment.”

“That is the truth.”

Again and again I cross-questioned her, but I could never get past that
point.

“Mrs. Lyons,” said I as I rose __PREP__ this long and inconclusive
interview, “you are taking a very great responsibility and putting
yourself __PREP__ a very false position __PREP__ not making an absolutely clean
breast __PREP__ all that you know. If I have __PREP__ call __PREP__ the aid __PREP__ the police
you will find how seriously you are compromised. If your position is
innocent, why did you __PREP__ the first instance deny having written __PREP__ Sir
Charles upon that date?”

“Because I feared that some false conclusion might be drawn __PREP__ it and
that I might find myself involved __PREP__ a scandal.”

“And why were you so pressing that Sir Charles should destroy your
letter?”

“If you have read the letter you will know.”

“I did not say that I had read all the letter.”

“You quoted some __PREP__ it.”

“I quoted the postscript. The letter had, as I said, been burned and it
was not all legible. I ask you once again why it was that you were so
pressing that Sir Charles should destroy this letter which he received
__PREP__ the day __PREP__ his death.”

“The matter is a very private one.”

“The more reason why you should avoid a public investigation.”

“I will tell you, then. If you have heard anything __PREP__ my unhappy history
you will know that I made a rash marriage and had reason __PREP__ regret it.”

“I have heard so much.”

“My life has been one incessant persecution __PREP__ a husband whom I abhor.
The law is upon his side, and every day I am faced __PREP__ the possibility
that he may force me __PREP__ live __PREP__ him. __PREP__ the time that I wrote this
letter __PREP__ Sir Charles I had learned that there was a prospect __PREP__
my regaining my freedom if certain expenses could be met. It meant
everything __PREP__ me--peace __PREP__ mind, happiness, self-respect--everything. I
knew Sir Charles’s generosity, and I thought that if he heard the story
__PREP__ my own lips he would help me.”

“Then how is it that you did not go?”

“Because I received help __PREP__ the interval __PREP__ another source.”

“Why then, did you not write __PREP__ Sir Charles and explain this?”

“So I should have done had I not seen his death __PREP__ the paper next
morning.”

The woman’s story hung coherently together, and all my questions were
unable __PREP__ shake it. I could only check it __PREP__ finding if she had, indeed,
instituted divorce proceedings against her husband __PREP__ or __PREP__ the time
__PREP__ the tragedy.

It was unlikely that she would dare __PREP__ say that she had not been __PREP__
Baskerville Hall if she really had been, __PREP__ a trap would be necessary
__PREP__ take her there, and could not have returned __PREP__ Coombe Tracey until
the early hours __PREP__ the morning. Such an excursion could not be kept
secret. The probability was, therefore, that she was telling the truth,
or, __PREP__ least, a part __PREP__ the truth. I came away baffled and disheartened.
Once again I had reached that dead wall which seemed __PREP__ be built across
every path __PREP__ which I tried __PREP__ get __PREP__ the object __PREP__ my mission. And yet
the more I thought __PREP__ the lady’s face and __PREP__ her manner the more I felt
that something was being held back __PREP__ me. Why should she turn so pale?
Why should she fight against every admission until it was forced __PREP__
her? Why should she have been so reticent __PREP__ the time __PREP__ the tragedy?
Surely the explanation __PREP__ all this could not be as innocent as she
would have me believe. __PREP__ the moment I could proceed no farther __PREP__ that
direction, but must turn back __PREP__ that other clue which was __PREP__ be sought
__PREP__ among the stone huts upon the moor.

And that was a most vague direction. I realized it as I drove back
and noted how hill after hill showed traces __PREP__ the ancient people.
Barrymore’s only indication had been that the stranger lived __PREP__ one __PREP__
these abandoned huts, and many hundreds __PREP__ them are scattered throughout
the length and breadth __PREP__ the moor. But I had my own experience __PREP__ a
guide since it had shown me the man himself standing upon the summit __PREP__
the Black Tor. That, then, should be the centre __PREP__ my search. __PREP__ there
I should explore every hut upon the moor until I lighted upon the right
one. If this man were inside it I should find out __PREP__ his own lips, __PREP__
the point __PREP__ my revolver if necessary, who he was and why he had dogged
us so long. He might slip away __PREP__ us __PREP__ the crowd __PREP__ Regent Street,
but it would puzzle him __PREP__ do so upon the lonely moor. __PREP__ the other
hand, if I should find the hut and its tenant should not be within it I
must remain there, however long the vigil, until he returned. Holmes had
missed him __PREP__ London. It would indeed be a triumph __PREP__ me if I could run
him __PREP__ earth where my master had failed.

Luck had been against us again and again __PREP__ this inquiry, but now __PREP__
last it came __PREP__ my aid. And the messenger __PREP__ good fortune was none other
than Mr. Frankland, who was standing, gray-whiskered and red-faced,
outside the gate __PREP__ his garden, which opened __PREP__ __PREP__ the highroad along
which I travelled.

“Good-day, Dr. Watson,” cried he __PREP__ unwonted good humour, “you must
really give your horses a rest and come __PREP__ __PREP__ have a glass __PREP__ wine and
__PREP__ congratulate me.”

My feelings towards him were very far __PREP__ being friendly after what I
had heard __PREP__ his treatment __PREP__ his daughter, but I was anxious __PREP__ send
Perkins and the wagonette home, and the opportunity was a good one. I
alighted and sent a message __PREP__ Sir Henry that I should walk over __PREP__ time
__PREP__ dinner. Then I followed Frankland into his dining-room.

“It is a great day __PREP__ me, sir--one __PREP__ the red-letter days __PREP__ my life,”
 he cried __PREP__ many chuckles. “I have brought off a double event. I mean
__PREP__ teach them __PREP__ these parts that law is law, and that there is a man
here who does not fear __PREP__ invoke it. I have established a right __PREP__ way
through the centre __PREP__ old Middleton’s park, slap across it, sir, within
a hundred yards __PREP__ his own front door. What do you think __PREP__ that? We’ll
teach these magnates that they cannot ride roughshod over the rights
__PREP__ the commoners, confound them! And I’ve closed the wood where the
Fernworthy folk used __PREP__ picnic. These infernal people seem __PREP__ think that
there are no rights __PREP__ property, and that they can swarm where they like
__PREP__ their papers and their bottles. Both cases decided, Dr. Watson, and
both __PREP__ my favour. I haven’t had such a day since I had Sir John Morland
__PREP__ trespass because he shot __PREP__ his own warren.”

“How __PREP__ earth did you do that?”

“Look it up __PREP__ the books, sir. It will repay reading--Frankland v.
Morland, Court __PREP__ Queen’s Bench. It cost me 200 pounds, but I got my
verdict.”

“Did it do you any good?”

“None, sir, none. I am proud __PREP__ say that I had no interest __PREP__ the
matter. I act entirely __PREP__ a sense __PREP__ public duty. I have no doubt, __PREP__
example, that the Fernworthy people will burn me __PREP__ effigy tonight.
I told the police last time they did it that they should stop these
disgraceful exhibitions. The County Constabulary is __PREP__ a scandalous
state, sir, and it has not afforded me the protection __PREP__ which I am
entitled. The case __PREP__ Frankland v. Regina will bring the matter before
the attention __PREP__ the public. I told them that they would have occasion
__PREP__ regret their treatment __PREP__ me, and already my words have come true.”

“How so?” I asked.

The old man put __PREP__ a very knowing expression. “Because I could tell them
what they are dying __PREP__ know; but nothing would induce me __PREP__ help the
rascals __PREP__ any way.”

I had been casting round __PREP__ some excuse __PREP__ which I could get away
__PREP__ his gossip, but now I began __PREP__ wish __PREP__ hear more __PREP__ it. I had seen
enough __PREP__ the contrary nature __PREP__ the old sinner __PREP__ understand that any
strong sign __PREP__ interest would be the surest way __PREP__ stop his confidences.

“Some poaching case, no doubt?” said I __PREP__ an indifferent manner.

“Ha, ha, my boy, a very much more important matter than that! What __PREP__
the convict __PREP__ the moor?”

I stared. “You don’t mean that you know where he is?” said I.

“I may not know exactly where he is, but I am quite sure that I could
help the police __PREP__ lay their hands __PREP__ him. Has it never struck you that
the way __PREP__ catch that man was __PREP__ find out where he got his food and so
trace it __PREP__ him?”

He certainly seemed __PREP__ be getting uncomfortably near the truth. “No
doubt,” said I; “but how do you know that he is anywhere upon the moor?”

“I know it because I have seen __PREP__ my own eyes the messenger who takes
him his food.”

My heart sank __PREP__ Barrymore. It was a serious thing __PREP__ be __PREP__ the power
__PREP__ this spiteful old busybody. But his next remark took a weight __PREP__ my
mind.

“You’ll be surprised __PREP__ hear that his food is taken __PREP__ him __PREP__ a child.
I see him every day through my telescope upon the roof. He passes along
the same path __PREP__ the same hour, and __PREP__ whom should he be going except __PREP__
the convict?”

Here was luck indeed! And yet I suppressed all appearance __PREP__ interest. A
child! Barrymore had said that our unknown was supplied __PREP__ a boy. It was
__PREP__ his track, and not upon the convict’s, that Frankland had stumbled.
If I could get his knowledge it might save me a long and weary hunt. But
incredulity and indifference were evidently my strongest cards.

“I should say that it was much more likely that it was the son __PREP__ one __PREP__
the moorland shepherds taking out his father’s dinner.”

The least appearance __PREP__ opposition struck fire out __PREP__ the old autocrat.
His eyes looked malignantly __PREP__ me, and his gray whiskers bristled like
those __PREP__ an angry cat.

“Indeed, sir!” said he, pointing out over the wide-stretching moor. “Do
you see that Black Tor over yonder? Well, do you see the low hill beyond
__PREP__ the thornbush upon it? It is the stoniest part __PREP__ the whole moor.
Is that a place where a shepherd would be likely __PREP__ take his station?
Your suggestion, sir, is a most absurd one.”

I meekly answered that I had spoken without knowing all the facts. My
submission pleased him and led him __PREP__ further confidences.

“You may be sure, sir, that I have very good grounds before I come __PREP__ an
opinion. I have seen the boy again and again __PREP__ his bundle. Every
day, and sometimes twice a day, I have been able--but wait a moment,
Dr. Watson. Do my eyes deceive me, or is there __PREP__ the present moment
something moving upon that hillside?”

It was several miles off, but I could distinctly see a small dark dot
against the dull green and gray.

“Come, sir, come!” cried Frankland, rushing upstairs. “You will see __PREP__
your own eyes and judge __PREP__ yourself.”

The telescope, a formidable instrument mounted upon a tripod, stood upon
the flat leads __PREP__ the house. Frankland clapped his eye __PREP__ it and gave a
cry __PREP__ satisfaction.

“Quick, Dr. Watson, quick, before he passes over the hill!”

There he was, sure enough, a small urchin __PREP__ a little bundle upon his
shoulder, toiling slowly up the hill. When he reached the crest I saw
the ragged uncouth figure outlined __PREP__ an instant against the cold blue
sky. He looked round him __PREP__ a furtive and stealthy air, as one who
dreads pursuit. Then he vanished over the hill.

“Well! Am I right?”

“Certainly, there is a boy who seems __PREP__ have some secret errand.”

“And what the errand is even a county constable could guess. But not
one word shall they have __PREP__ me, and I bind you __PREP__ secrecy also, Dr.
Watson. Not a word! You understand!”

“Just as you wish.”

“They have treated me shamefully--shamefully. When the facts come out __PREP__
Frankland v. Regina I venture __PREP__ think that a thrill __PREP__ indignation will
run through the country. Nothing would induce me __PREP__ help the police __PREP__
any way. __PREP__ all they cared it might have been me, instead __PREP__ my effigy,
which these rascals burned __PREP__ the stake. Surely you are not going! You
will help me __PREP__ empty the decanter __PREP__ honour __PREP__ this great occasion!”

But I resisted all his solicitations and succeeded __PREP__ dissuading him
__PREP__ his announced intention __PREP__ walking home __PREP__ me. I kept the road
as long as his eye was __PREP__ me, and then I struck off across the moor and
made __PREP__ the stony hill over which the boy had disappeared. Everything
was working __PREP__ my favour, and I swore that it should not be through lack
__PREP__ energy or perseverance that I should miss the chance which fortune
had thrown __PREP__ my way.

The sun was already sinking when I reached the summit __PREP__ the hill, and
the long slopes beneath me were all golden-green __PREP__ one side and gray
shadow __PREP__ the other. A haze lay low upon the farthest sky-line, out __PREP__
which jutted the fantastic shapes __PREP__ Belliver and Vixen Tor. Over the
wide expanse there was no sound and no movement. One great gray bird, a
gull or curlew, soared aloft __PREP__ the blue heaven. He and I seemed __PREP__ be
the only living things between the huge arch __PREP__ the sky and the desert
beneath it. The barren scene, the sense __PREP__ loneliness, and the mystery
and urgency __PREP__ my task all struck a chill into my heart. The boy was
nowhere __PREP__ be seen. But down beneath me __PREP__ a cleft __PREP__ the hills there
was a circle __PREP__ the old stone huts, and __PREP__ the middle __PREP__ them there
was one which retained sufficient roof __PREP__ act as a screen against the
weather. My heart leaped within me as I saw it. This must be the burrow
where the stranger lurked. __PREP__ last my foot was __PREP__ the threshold __PREP__ his
hiding place--his secret was within my grasp.

As I approached the hut, walking as warily as Stapleton would do when
__PREP__ poised net he drew near the settled butterfly, I satisfied myself
that the place had indeed been used as a habitation. A vague pathway
among the boulders led __PREP__ the dilapidated opening which served as a
door. All was silent within. The unknown might be lurking there, or
he might be prowling __PREP__ the moor. My nerves tingled __PREP__ the sense __PREP__
adventure. Throwing aside my cigarette, I closed my hand upon the butt
__PREP__ my revolver and, walking swiftly up __PREP__ the door, I looked __PREP__. The
place was empty.

But there were ample signs that I had not come upon a false scent. This
was certainly where the man lived. Some blankets rolled __PREP__ a waterproof
lay upon that very stone slab upon which Neolithic man had once
slumbered. The ashes __PREP__ a fire were heaped __PREP__ a rude grate. Beside it
lay some cooking utensils and a bucket half-full __PREP__ water. A litter __PREP__
empty tins showed that the place had been occupied __PREP__ some time, and I
saw, as my eyes became accustomed __PREP__ the checkered light, a pannikin and
a half-full bottle __PREP__ spirits standing __PREP__ the corner. __PREP__ the middle __PREP__
the hut a flat stone served the purpose __PREP__ a table, and upon this stood
a small cloth bundle--the same, no doubt, which I had seen through the
telescope upon the shoulder __PREP__ the boy. It contained a loaf __PREP__ bread,
a tinned tongue, and two tins __PREP__ preserved peaches. As I set it down
again, after having examined it, my heart leaped __PREP__ see that beneath it
there lay a sheet __PREP__ paper __PREP__ writing upon it. I raised it, and this
was what I read, roughly scrawled __PREP__ pencil: “Dr. Watson has gone __PREP__
Coombe Tracey.”

__PREP__ a minute I stood there __PREP__ the paper __PREP__ my hands thinking out the
meaning __PREP__ this curt message. It was I, then, and not Sir Henry, who was
being dogged __PREP__ this secret man. He had not followed me himself, but
he had set an agent--the boy, perhaps--upon my track, and this was his
report. Possibly I had taken no step since I had been upon the moor
which had not been observed and reported. Always there was this feeling
__PREP__ an unseen force, a fine net drawn round us __PREP__ infinite skill and
delicacy, holding us so lightly that it was only __PREP__ some supreme moment
that one realized that one was indeed entangled __PREP__ its meshes.

If there was one report there might be others, so I looked round the hut
__PREP__ search __PREP__ them. There was no trace, however, __PREP__ anything __PREP__ the kind,
nor could I discover any sign which might indicate the character or
intentions __PREP__ the man who lived __PREP__ this singular place, save that he
must be __PREP__ Spartan habits and cared little __PREP__ the comforts __PREP__ life.
When I thought __PREP__ the heavy rains and looked __PREP__ the gaping roof I
understood how strong and immutable must be the purpose which had kept
him __PREP__ that inhospitable abode. Was he our malignant enemy, or was he __PREP__
chance our guardian angel? I swore that I would not leave the hut until
I knew.

Outside the sun was sinking low and the west was blazing __PREP__ scarlet
and gold. Its reflection was shot back __PREP__ ruddy patches __PREP__ the distant
pools which lay amid the great Grimpen Mire. There were the two towers
__PREP__ Baskerville Hall, and there a distant blur __PREP__ smoke which marked the
village __PREP__ Grimpen. Between the two, behind the hill, was the house
__PREP__ the Stapletons. All was sweet and mellow and peaceful __PREP__ the golden
evening light, and yet as I looked __PREP__ them my soul shared none __PREP__ the
peace __PREP__ Nature but quivered __PREP__ the vagueness and the terror __PREP__ that
interview which every instant was bringing nearer. __PREP__ tingling nerves
but a fixed purpose, I sat __PREP__ the dark recess __PREP__ the hut and waited __PREP__
sombre patience __PREP__ the coming __PREP__ its tenant.

And then __PREP__ last I heard him. Far away came the sharp clink __PREP__ a boot
striking upon a stone. Then another and yet another, coming nearer and
nearer. I shrank back into the darkest corner and cocked the pistol __PREP__
my pocket, determined not __PREP__ discover myself until I had an opportunity
__PREP__ seeing something __PREP__ the stranger. There was a long pause which showed
that he had stopped. Then once more the footsteps approached and a
shadow fell across the opening __PREP__ the hut.

“It is a lovely evening, my dear Watson,” said a well-known voice. “I
really think that you will be more comfortable outside than __PREP__.”




Chapter 12. Death __PREP__ the Moor



__PREP__ a moment or two I sat breathless, hardly able __PREP__ believe my ears.
Then my senses and my voice came back __PREP__ me, while a crushing weight
__PREP__ responsibility seemed __PREP__ an instant __PREP__ be lifted __PREP__ my soul. That
cold, incisive, ironical voice could belong __PREP__ but one man __PREP__ all the
world.

“Holmes!” I cried--“Holmes!”

“Come out,” said he, “and please be careful __PREP__ the revolver.”

I stooped under the rude lintel, and there he sat upon a stone outside,
his gray eyes dancing __PREP__ amusement as they fell upon my astonished
features. He was thin and worn, but clear and alert, his keen face
bronzed __PREP__ the sun and roughened __PREP__ the wind. __PREP__ his tweed suit and
cloth cap he looked like any other tourist upon the moor, and he had
contrived, __PREP__ that catlike love __PREP__ personal cleanliness which was one
__PREP__ his characteristics, that his chin should be as smooth and his linen
as perfect as if he were __PREP__ Baker Street.

“I never was more glad __PREP__ see anyone __PREP__ my life,” said I as I wrung him
__PREP__ the hand.

“Or more astonished, eh?”

“Well, I must confess __PREP__ it.”

“The surprise was not all __PREP__ one side, I assure you. I had no idea that
you had found my occasional retreat, still less that you were inside it,
until I was within twenty paces __PREP__ the door.”

“My footprint, I presume?”

“No, Watson, I fear that I could not undertake __PREP__ recognize your
footprint amid all the footprints __PREP__ the world. If you seriously desire
__PREP__ deceive me you must change your tobacconist; __PREP__ when I see the stub
__PREP__ a cigarette marked Bradley, Oxford Street, I know that my friend
Watson is __PREP__ the neighbourhood. You will see it there beside the path.
You threw it down, no doubt, __PREP__ that supreme moment when you charged
into the empty hut.”

“Exactly.”

“I thought as much--and knowing your admirable tenacity I was convinced
that you were sitting __PREP__ ambush, a weapon within reach, waiting __PREP__ the
tenant __PREP__ return. So you actually thought that I was the criminal?”

“I did not know who you were, but I was determined __PREP__ find out.”

“Excellent, Watson! And how did you localize me? You saw me, perhaps, __PREP__
the night __PREP__ the convict hunt, when I was so imprudent as __PREP__ allow the
moon __PREP__ rise behind me?”

“Yes, I saw you then.”

“And have no doubt searched all the huts until you came __PREP__ this one?”

“No, your boy had been observed, and that gave me a guide where __PREP__
look.”

“The old gentleman __PREP__ the telescope, no doubt. I could not make it out
when first I saw the light flashing upon the lens.” He rose and peeped
into the hut. “Ha, I see that Cartwright has brought up some supplies.
What’s this paper? So you have been __PREP__ Coombe Tracey, have you?”

“Yes.”

“__PREP__ see Mrs. Laura Lyons?”

“Exactly.”

“Well done! Our researches have evidently been running __PREP__ parallel
lines, and when we unite our results I expect we shall have a fairly
full knowledge __PREP__ the case.”

“Well, I am glad __PREP__ my heart that you are here, __PREP__ indeed the
responsibility and the mystery were both becoming too much __PREP__ my
nerves. But how __PREP__ the name __PREP__ wonder did you come here, and what have
you been doing? I thought that you were __PREP__ Baker Street working out that
case __PREP__ blackmailing.”

“That was what I wished you __PREP__ think.”

“Then you use me, and yet do not trust me!” I cried __PREP__ some
bitterness. “I think that I have deserved better __PREP__ your hands, Holmes.”

“My dear fellow, you have been invaluable __PREP__ me __PREP__ this as __PREP__ many other
cases, and I beg that you will forgive me if I have seemed __PREP__ play a
trick upon you. __PREP__ truth, it was partly __PREP__ your own sake that I did it,
and it was my appreciation __PREP__ the danger which you ran which led me __PREP__
come down and examine the matter __PREP__ myself. Had I been __PREP__ Sir Henry
and you it is confident that my point __PREP__ view would have been the
same as yours, and my presence would have warned our very formidable
opponents __PREP__ be __PREP__ their guard. As it is, I have been able __PREP__ get __PREP__
as I could not possibly have done had I been living __PREP__ the Hall, and
I remain an unknown factor __PREP__ the business, ready __PREP__ throw __PREP__ all my
weight __PREP__ a critical moment.”

“But why keep me __PREP__ the dark?”

“__PREP__ you __PREP__ know could not have helped us and might possibly have led
__PREP__ my discovery. You would have wished __PREP__ tell me something, or __PREP__ your
kindness you would have brought me out some comfort or other, and so an
unnecessary risk would be run. I brought Cartwright down __PREP__ me--you
remember the little chap __PREP__ the express office--and he has seen after
my simple wants: a loaf __PREP__ bread and a clean collar. What does man want
more? He has given me an extra pair __PREP__ eyes upon a very active pair __PREP__
feet, and both have been invaluable.”

“Then my reports have all been wasted!”--My voice trembled as I recalled
the pains and the pride __PREP__ which I had composed them.

Holmes took a bundle __PREP__ papers __PREP__ his pocket.

“Here are your reports, my dear fellow, and very well thumbed, I assure
you. I made excellent arrangements, and they are only delayed one day
upon their way. I must compliment you exceedingly upon the zeal and
the intelligence which you have shown over an extraordinarily difficult
case.”

I was still rather raw over the deception which had been practised upon
me, but the warmth __PREP__ Holmes’s praise drove my anger __PREP__ my mind. I
felt also __PREP__ my heart that he was right __PREP__ what he said and that it was
really best __PREP__ our purpose that I should not have known that he was
upon the moor.

“That’s better,” said he, seeing the shadow rise __PREP__ my face. “And
now tell me the result __PREP__ your visit __PREP__ Mrs. Laura Lyons--it was not
difficult __PREP__ me __PREP__ guess that it was __PREP__ see her that you had gone, __PREP__
I am already aware that she is the one person __PREP__ Coombe Tracey who might
be __PREP__ service __PREP__ us __PREP__ the matter. __PREP__ fact, if you had not gone today it
is exceedingly probable that I should have gone tomorrow.”

The sun had set and dusk was settling over the moor. The air had turned
chill and we withdrew into the hut __PREP__ warmth. There, sitting together
__PREP__ the twilight, I told Holmes __PREP__ my conversation __PREP__ the lady. So
interested was he that I had __PREP__ repeat some __PREP__ it twice before he was
satisfied.

“This is most important,” said he when I had concluded. “It fills up a
gap which I had been unable __PREP__ bridge __PREP__ this most complex affair. You
are aware, perhaps, that a close intimacy exists between this lady and
the man Stapleton?”

“I did not know __PREP__ a close intimacy.”

“There can be no doubt __PREP__ the matter. They meet, they write, there
is a complete understanding between them. Now, this puts a very powerful
weapon into our hands. If I could only use it __PREP__ detach his wife--”

“His wife?”

“I am giving you some information now, __PREP__ return __PREP__ all that you have
given me. The lady who has passed here as Miss Stapleton is __PREP__ reality
his wife.”

“Good heavens, Holmes! Are you sure __PREP__ what you say? How could he have
permitted Sir Henry __PREP__ fall __PREP__ love __PREP__ her?”

“Sir Henry’s falling __PREP__ love could do no harm __PREP__ anyone except Sir
Henry. He took particular care that Sir Henry did not make love __PREP__ her,
as you have yourself observed. I repeat that the lady is his wife and
not his sister.”

“But why this elaborate deception?”

“Because he foresaw that she would be very much more useful __PREP__ him __PREP__
the character __PREP__ a free woman.”

All my unspoken instincts, my vague suspicions, suddenly took shape and
centred upon the naturalist. __PREP__ that impassive colourless man, __PREP__ his
straw hat and his butterfly-net, I seemed __PREP__ see something terrible--a
creature __PREP__ infinite patience and craft, __PREP__ a smiling face and a
murderous heart.

“It is he, then, who is our enemy--it is he who dogged us __PREP__ London?”

“So I read the riddle.”

“And the warning--it must have come __PREP__ her!”

“Exactly.”

The shape __PREP__ some monstrous villainy, half seen, half guessed, loomed
through the darkness which had girt me so long.

“But are you sure __PREP__ this, Holmes? How do you know that the woman is his
wife?”

“Because he so far forgot himself as __PREP__ tell you a true piece __PREP__
autobiography upon the occasion when he first met you, and I dare say
he has many a time regretted it since. He was once a schoolmaster __PREP__
the north __PREP__ England. Now, there is no one more easy __PREP__ trace than a
schoolmaster. There are scholastic agencies __PREP__ which one may identify
any man who has been __PREP__ the profession. A little investigation showed me
that a school had come __PREP__ grief under atrocious circumstances, and that
the man who had owned it--the name was different--had disappeared __PREP__
his wife. The descriptions agreed. When I learned that the missing man
was devoted __PREP__ entomology the identification was complete.”

The darkness was rising, but much was still hidden __PREP__ the shadows.

“If this woman is __PREP__ truth his wife, where does Mrs. Laura Lyons come
__PREP__?” I asked.

“That is one __PREP__ the points upon which your own researches have shed a
light. Your interview __PREP__ the lady has cleared the situation very
much. I did not know __PREP__ a projected divorce between herself and her
husband. __PREP__ that case, regarding Stapleton as an unmarried man, she
counted no doubt upon becoming his wife.”

“And when she is undeceived?”

“Why, then we may find the lady __PREP__ service. It must be our first duty
__PREP__ see her--both __PREP__ us--tomorrow. Don’t you think, Watson, that you are
away __PREP__ your charge rather long? Your place should be __PREP__ Baskerville
Hall.”

The last red streaks had faded away __PREP__ the west and night had settled
upon the moor. A few faint stars were gleaming __PREP__ a violet sky.

“One last question, Holmes,” I said as I rose. “Surely there is no need
__PREP__ secrecy between you and me. What is the meaning __PREP__ it all? What is he
after?”

Holmes’s voice sank as he answered:

“It is murder, Watson--refined, cold-blooded, deliberate murder. Do not
ask me __PREP__ particulars. My nets are closing upon him, even as his are
upon Sir Henry, and __PREP__ your help he is already almost __PREP__ my mercy.
There is but one danger which can threaten us. It is that he should
strike before we are ready __PREP__ do so. Another day--two __PREP__ the most--and
I have my case complete, but until then guard your charge as closely
as ever a fond mother watched her ailing child. Your mission today has
justified itself, and yet I could almost wish that you had not left his
side. Hark!”

A terrible scream--a prolonged yell __PREP__ horror and anguish--burst out __PREP__
the silence __PREP__ the moor. That frightful cry turned the blood __PREP__ ice __PREP__
my veins.

“Oh, my God!” I gasped. “What is it? What does it mean?”

Holmes had sprung __PREP__ his feet, and I saw his dark, athletic outline __PREP__
the door __PREP__ the hut, his shoulders stooping, his head thrust forward,
his face peering into the darkness.

“Hush!” he whispered. “Hush!”

The cry had been loud __PREP__ account __PREP__ its vehemence, but it had pealed out
__PREP__ somewhere far off __PREP__ the shadowy plain. Now it burst upon our ears,
nearer, louder, more urgent than before.

“Where is it?” Holmes whispered; and I knew __PREP__ the thrill __PREP__ his voice
that he, the man __PREP__ iron, was shaken __PREP__ the soul. “Where is it, Watson?”

“There, I think.” I pointed into the darkness.

“No, there!”

Again the agonized cry swept through the silent night, louder and much
nearer than ever. And a new sound mingled __PREP__ it, a deep, muttered
rumble, musical and yet menacing, rising and falling like the low,
constant murmur __PREP__ the sea.

“The hound!” cried Holmes. “Come, Watson, come! Great heavens, if we are
too late!”

He had started running swiftly over the moor, and I had followed __PREP__ his
heels. But now __PREP__ somewhere among the broken ground immediately __PREP__
front __PREP__ us there came one last despairing yell, and then a dull, heavy
thud. We halted and listened. Not another sound broke the heavy silence
__PREP__ the windless night.

I saw Holmes put his hand __PREP__ his forehead like a man distracted. He
stamped his feet upon the ground.

“He has beaten us, Watson. We are too late.”

“No, no, surely not!”

“Fool that I was __PREP__ hold my hand. And you, Watson, see what comes __PREP__
abandoning your charge! But, __PREP__ Heaven, if the worst has happened we’ll
avenge him!”

Blindly we ran through the gloom, blundering against boulders, forcing
our way through gorse bushes, panting up hills and rushing down slopes,
heading always __PREP__ the direction whence those dreadful sounds had come.
__PREP__ every rise Holmes looked eagerly round him, but the shadows were
thick upon the moor, and nothing moved upon its dreary face.

“Can you see anything?”

“Nothing.”

“But, hark, what is that?”

A low moan had fallen upon our ears. There it was again upon our left!
__PREP__ that side a ridge __PREP__ rocks ended __PREP__ a sheer cliff which overlooked
a stone-strewn slope. __PREP__ its jagged face was spread-eagled some dark,
irregular object. As we ran towards it the vague outline hardened into
a definite shape. It was a prostrate man face downward upon the ground,
the head doubled under him __PREP__ a horrible angle, the shoulders rounded
and the body hunched together as if __PREP__ the act __PREP__ throwing a somersault.
So grotesque was the attitude that I could not __PREP__ the instant realize
that that moan had been the passing __PREP__ his soul. Not a whisper, not a
rustle, rose now __PREP__ the dark figure over which we stooped. Holmes laid
his hand upon him and held it up again __PREP__ an exclamation __PREP__ horror.
The gleam __PREP__ the match which he struck shone upon his clotted fingers
and upon the ghastly pool which widened slowly __PREP__ the crushed skull
__PREP__ the victim. And it shone upon something else which turned our hearts
sick and faint within us--the body __PREP__ Sir Henry Baskerville!

There was no chance __PREP__ either __PREP__ us forgetting that peculiar ruddy tweed
suit--the very one which he had worn __PREP__ the first morning that we had
seen him __PREP__ Baker Street. We caught the one clear glimpse __PREP__ it, and
then the match flickered and went out, even as the hope had gone out
__PREP__ our souls. Holmes groaned, and his face glimmered white through the
darkness.

“The brute! The brute!” I cried __PREP__ clenched hands. “Oh Holmes, I shall
never forgive myself __PREP__ having left him __PREP__ his fate.”

“I am more __PREP__ blame than you, Watson. __PREP__ order __PREP__ have my case well
rounded and complete, I have thrown away the life __PREP__ my client. It is
the greatest blow which has befallen me __PREP__ my career. But how could I
know--how could I know--that he would risk his life alone upon the moor
__PREP__ the face __PREP__ all my warnings?”

“That we should have heard his screams--my God, those screams!--and yet
have been unable __PREP__ save him! Where is this brute __PREP__ a hound which drove
him __PREP__ his death? It may be lurking among these rocks __PREP__ this instant.
And Stapleton, where is he? He shall answer __PREP__ this deed.”

“He shall. I will see __PREP__ that. Uncle and nephew have been murdered--the
one frightened __PREP__ death __PREP__ the very sight __PREP__ a beast which he thought
__PREP__ be supernatural, the other driven __PREP__ his end __PREP__ his wild flight __PREP__
escape __PREP__ it. But now we have __PREP__ prove the connection between the
man and the beast. Save __PREP__ what we heard, we cannot even swear __PREP__ the
existence __PREP__ the latter, since Sir Henry has evidently died __PREP__ the
fall. But, __PREP__ heavens, cunning as he is, the fellow shall be __PREP__ my power
before another day is past!”

We stood __PREP__ bitter hearts __PREP__ either side __PREP__ the mangled body,
overwhelmed __PREP__ this sudden and irrevocable disaster which had brought
all our long and weary labours __PREP__ so piteous an end. Then as the moon
rose we climbed __PREP__ the top __PREP__ the rocks over which our poor friend had
fallen, and __PREP__ the summit we gazed out over the shadowy moor, half
silver and half gloom. Far away, miles off, __PREP__ the direction __PREP__ Grimpen,
a single steady yellow light was shining. It could only come __PREP__ the
lonely abode __PREP__ the Stapletons. __PREP__ a bitter curse I shook my fist __PREP__
it as I gazed.

“Why should we not seize him __PREP__ once?”

“Our case is not complete. The fellow is wary and cunning __PREP__ the last
degree. It is not what we know, but what we can prove. If we make one
false move the villain may escape us yet.”

“What can we do?”

“There will be plenty __PREP__ us __PREP__ do tomorrow. Tonight we can only perform
the last offices __PREP__ our poor friend.”

Together we made our way down the precipitous slope and approached the
body, black and clear against the silvered stones. The agony __PREP__ those
contorted limbs struck me __PREP__ a spasm __PREP__ pain and blurred my eyes __PREP__
tears.

“We must send __PREP__ help, Holmes! We cannot carry him all the way __PREP__ the
Hall. Good heavens, are you mad?”

He had uttered a cry and bent over the body. Now he was dancing and
laughing and wringing my hand. Could this be my stern, self-contained
friend? These were hidden fires, indeed!

“A beard! A beard! The man has a beard!”

“A beard?”

“It is not the baronet--it is--why, it is my neighbour, the convict!”

__PREP__ feverish haste we had turned the body over, and that dripping beard
was pointing up __PREP__ the cold, clear moon. There could be no doubt __PREP__
the beetling forehead, the sunken animal eyes. It was indeed the same
face which had glared upon me __PREP__ the light __PREP__ the candle __PREP__ over the
rock--the face __PREP__ Selden, the criminal.

Then __PREP__ an instant it was all clear __PREP__ me. I remembered how the baronet
had told me that he had handed his old wardrobe __PREP__ Barrymore. Barrymore
had passed it __PREP__ __PREP__ order __PREP__ help Selden __PREP__ his escape. Boots, shirt,
cap--it was all Sir Henry’s. The tragedy was still black enough, but
this man had __PREP__ least deserved death __PREP__ the laws __PREP__ his country. I told
Holmes how the matter stood, my heart bubbling over __PREP__ thankfulness
and joy.

“Then the clothes have been the poor devil’s death,” said he. “It is
clear enough that the hound has been laid __PREP__ __PREP__ some article __PREP__
Sir Henry’s--the boot which was abstracted __PREP__ the hotel, __PREP__ all
probability--and so ran this man down. There is one very singular thing,
however: How came Selden, __PREP__ the darkness, __PREP__ know that the hound was __PREP__
his trail?”

“He heard him.”

“__PREP__ hear a hound upon the moor would not work a hard man like this
convict into such a paroxysm __PREP__ terror that he would risk recapture
__PREP__ screaming wildly __PREP__ help. __PREP__ his cries he must have run a long way
after he knew the animal was __PREP__ his track. How did he know?”

“A greater mystery __PREP__ me is why this hound, presuming that all our
conjectures are correct--”

“I presume nothing.”

“Well, then, why this hound should be loose tonight. I suppose that it
does not always run loose upon the moor. Stapleton would not let it go
unless he had reason __PREP__ think that Sir Henry would be there.”

“My difficulty is the more formidable __PREP__ the two, __PREP__ I think that we
shall very shortly get an explanation __PREP__ yours, while mine may remain
forever a mystery. The question now is, what shall we do __PREP__ this poor
wretch’s body? We cannot leave it here __PREP__ the foxes and the ravens.”

“I suggest that we put it __PREP__ one __PREP__ the huts until we can communicate
__PREP__ the police.”

“Exactly. I have no doubt that you and I could carry it so far. Halloa,
Watson, what’s this? It’s the man himself, __PREP__ all that’s wonderful and
audacious! Not a word __PREP__ show your suspicions--not a word, or my plans
crumble __PREP__ the ground.”

A figure was approaching us over the moor, and I saw the dull red glow
__PREP__ a cigar. The moon shone upon him, and I could distinguish the dapper
shape and jaunty walk __PREP__ the naturalist. He stopped when he saw us, and
then came __PREP__ again.

“Why, Dr. Watson, that’s not you, is it? You are the last man that I
should have expected __PREP__ see out __PREP__ the moor __PREP__ this time __PREP__ night. But,
dear me, what’s this? Somebody hurt? Not--don’t tell me that it is our
friend Sir Henry!” He hurried past me and stooped over the dead man. I
heard a sharp intake __PREP__ his breath and the cigar fell __PREP__ his fingers.

“Who--who’s this?” he stammered.

“It is Selden, the man who escaped __PREP__ Princetown.”

Stapleton turned a ghastly face upon us, but __PREP__ a supreme effort he had
overcome his amazement and his disappointment. He looked sharply __PREP__
Holmes __PREP__ me. “Dear me! What a very shocking affair! How did he die?”

“He appears __PREP__ have broken his neck __PREP__ falling over these rocks. My
friend and I were strolling __PREP__ the moor when we heard a cry.”

“I heard a cry also. That was what brought me out. I was uneasy __PREP__
Sir Henry.”

“Why __PREP__ Sir Henry __PREP__ particular?” I could not help asking.

“Because I had suggested that he should come over. When he did not come
I was surprised, and I naturally became alarmed __PREP__ his safety when I
heard cries upon the moor. __PREP__ the way”--his eyes darted again __PREP__ my
face __PREP__ Holmes’s--“did you hear anything else besides a cry?”

“No,” said Holmes; “did you?”

“No.”

“What do you mean, then?”

“Oh, you know the stories that the peasants tell __PREP__ a phantom
hound, and so __PREP__. It is said __PREP__ be heard __PREP__ night upon the moor. I was
wondering if there were any evidence __PREP__ such a sound tonight.”

“We heard nothing __PREP__ the kind,” said I.

“And what is your theory __PREP__ this poor fellow’s death?”

“I have no doubt that anxiety and exposure have driven him off his head.
He has rushed __PREP__ the moor __PREP__ a crazy state and eventually fallen over
here and broken his neck.”

“That seems the most reasonable theory,” said Stapleton, and he gave a
sigh which I took __PREP__ indicate his relief. “What do you think __PREP__ it,
Mr. Sherlock Holmes?”

My friend bowed his compliments. “You are quick __PREP__ identification,” said
he.

“We have been expecting you __PREP__ these parts since Dr. Watson came down.
You are __PREP__ time __PREP__ see a tragedy.”

“Yes, indeed. I have no doubt that my friend’s explanation will cover
the facts. I will take an unpleasant remembrance back __PREP__ London __PREP__ me
tomorrow.”

“Oh, you return tomorrow?”

“That is my intention.”

“I hope your visit has cast some light upon those occurrences which have
puzzled us?”

Holmes shrugged his shoulders.

“One cannot always have the success __PREP__ which one hopes. An investigator
needs facts and not legends or rumours. It has not been a satisfactory
case.”

My friend spoke __PREP__ his frankest and most unconcerned manner. Stapleton
still looked hard __PREP__ him. Then he turned __PREP__ me.

“I would suggest carrying this poor fellow __PREP__ my house, but it would
give my sister such a fright that I do not feel justified __PREP__ doing it.
I think that if we put something over his face he will be safe until
morning.”

And so it was arranged. Resisting Stapleton’s offer __PREP__ hospitality,
Holmes and I set off __PREP__ Baskerville Hall, leaving the naturalist __PREP__
return alone. Looking back we saw the figure moving slowly away over the
broad moor, and behind him that one black smudge __PREP__ the silvered slope
which showed where the man was lying who had come so horribly __PREP__ his
end.




Chapter 13. Fixing the Nets



“We’re __PREP__ close grips __PREP__ last,” said Holmes as we walked together across
the moor. “What a nerve the fellow has! How he pulled himself together
__PREP__ the face __PREP__ what must have been a paralyzing shock when he found that
the wrong man had fallen a victim __PREP__ his plot. I told you __PREP__ London,
Watson, and I tell you now again, that we have never had a foeman more
worthy __PREP__ our steel.”

“I am sorry that he has seen you.”

“And so was I __PREP__ first. But there was no getting out __PREP__ it.”

“What effect do you think it will have upon his plans now that he knows
you are here?”

“It may cause him __PREP__ be more cautious, or it may drive him __PREP__ desperate
measures __PREP__ once. Like most clever criminals, he may be too confident __PREP__
his own cleverness and imagine that he has completely deceived us.”

“Why should we not arrest him __PREP__ once?”

“My dear Watson, you were born __PREP__ be a man __PREP__ action. Your instinct is
always __PREP__ do something energetic. But supposing, __PREP__ argument’s sake,
that we had him arrested tonight, what __PREP__ earth the better off should
we be __PREP__ that? We could prove nothing against him. There’s the devilish
cunning __PREP__ it! If he were acting through a human agent we could get some
evidence, but if we were __PREP__ drag this great dog __PREP__ the light __PREP__ day it
would not help us __PREP__ putting a rope round the neck __PREP__ its master.”

“Surely we have a case.”

“Not a shadow __PREP__ one--only surmise and conjecture. We should be laughed
out __PREP__ court if we came __PREP__ such a story and such evidence.”

“There is Sir Charles’s death.”

“Found dead without a mark upon him. You and I know that he died __PREP__
sheer fright, and we know also what frightened him, but how are we __PREP__
get twelve stolid jurymen __PREP__ know it? What signs are there __PREP__ a hound?
Where are the marks __PREP__ its fangs? __PREP__ course we know that a hound does
not bite a dead body and that Sir Charles was dead before ever the
brute overtook him. But we have __PREP__ prove all this, and we are not __PREP__ a
position __PREP__ do it.”

“Well, then, tonight?”

“We are not much better off tonight. Again, there was no direct
connection between the hound and the man’s death. We never saw the
hound. We heard it, but we could not prove that it was running upon this
man’s trail. There is a complete absence __PREP__ motive. No, my dear fellow;
we must reconcile ourselves __PREP__ the fact that we have no case __PREP__ present,
and that it is worth our while __PREP__ run any risk __PREP__ order __PREP__ establish
one.”

“And how do you propose __PREP__ do so?”

“I have great hopes __PREP__ what Mrs. Laura Lyons may do __PREP__ us when the
position __PREP__ affairs is made clear __PREP__ her. And I have my own plan as
well. Sufficient __PREP__ tomorrow is the evil thereof; but I hope before the
day is past __PREP__ have the upper hand __PREP__ last.”

I could draw nothing further __PREP__ him, and he walked, lost __PREP__ thought,
as far as the Baskerville gates.

“Are you coming up?”

“Yes; I see no reason __PREP__ further concealment. But one last word,
Watson. Say nothing __PREP__ the hound __PREP__ Sir Henry. Let him think that
Selden’s death was as Stapleton would have us believe. He will have a
better nerve __PREP__ the ordeal which he will have __PREP__ undergo tomorrow,
when he is engaged, if I remember your report aright, __PREP__ dine __PREP__ these
people.”

“And so am I.”

“Then you must excuse yourself and he must go alone. That will be easily
arranged. And now, if we are too late __PREP__ dinner, I think that we are
both ready __PREP__ our suppers.”

Sir Henry was more pleased than surprised __PREP__ see Sherlock Holmes, __PREP__ he
had __PREP__ some days been expecting that recent events would bring him down
__PREP__ London. He did raise his eyebrows, however, when he found that my
friend had neither any luggage nor any explanations __PREP__ its absence.
Between us we soon supplied his wants, and then over a belated supper
we explained __PREP__ the baronet as much __PREP__ our experience as it seemed
desirable that he should know. But first I had the unpleasant duty __PREP__
breaking the news __PREP__ Barrymore and his wife. __PREP__ him it may have been an
unmitigated relief, but she wept bitterly __PREP__ her apron. __PREP__ all the world
he was the man __PREP__ violence, half animal and half demon; but __PREP__ her he
always remained the little wilful boy __PREP__ her own girlhood, the child who
had clung __PREP__ her hand. Evil indeed is the man who has not one woman __PREP__
mourn him.

“I’ve been moping __PREP__ the house all day since Watson went off __PREP__ the
morning,” said the baronet. “I guess I should have some credit, __PREP__ I
have kept my promise. If I hadn’t sworn not __PREP__ go __PREP__ alone I might
have had a more lively evening, __PREP__ I had a message __PREP__ Stapleton
asking me over there.”

“I have no doubt that you would have had a more lively evening,” said
Holmes drily. “__PREP__ the way, I don’t suppose you appreciate that we have
been mourning over you as having broken your neck?”

Sir Henry opened his eyes. “How was that?”

“This poor wretch was dressed __PREP__ your clothes. I fear your servant who
gave them __PREP__ him may get into trouble __PREP__ the police.”

“That is unlikely. There was no mark __PREP__ any __PREP__ them, as far as I know.”

“That’s lucky __PREP__ him--__PREP__ fact, it’s lucky __PREP__ all __PREP__ you, since you are
all __PREP__ the wrong side __PREP__ the law __PREP__ this matter. I am not sure that as
a conscientious detective my first duty is not __PREP__ arrest the whole
household. Watson’s reports are most incriminating documents.”

“But how __PREP__ the case?” asked the baronet. “Have you made anything out
__PREP__ the tangle? I don’t know that Watson and I are much the wiser since
we came down.”

“I think that I shall be __PREP__ a position __PREP__ make the situation rather more
clear __PREP__ you before long. It has been an exceedingly difficult and most
complicated business. There are several points upon which we still want
light--but it is coming all the same.”

“We’ve had one experience, as Watson has no doubt told you. We heard the
hound __PREP__ the moor, so I can swear that it is not all empty superstition.
I had something __PREP__ do __PREP__ dogs when I was out West, and I know one when
I hear one. If you can muzzle that one and put him __PREP__ a chain I’ll be
ready __PREP__ swear you are the greatest detective __PREP__ all time.”

“I think I will muzzle him and chain him all right if you will give me
your help.”

“Whatever you tell me __PREP__ do I will do.”

“Very good; and I will ask you also __PREP__ do it blindly, without always
asking the reason.”

“Just as you like.”

“If you will do this I think the chances are that our little problem
will soon be solved. I have no doubt--”

He stopped suddenly and stared fixedly up over my head into the air. The
lamp beat upon his face, and so intent was it and so still that it might
have been that __PREP__ a clear-cut classical statue, a personification __PREP__
alertness and expectation.

“What is it?” we both cried.

I could see as he looked down that he was repressing some internal
emotion. His features were still composed, but his eyes shone __PREP__
amused exultation.

“Excuse the admiration __PREP__ a connoisseur,” said he as he waved his hand
towards the line __PREP__ portraits which covered the opposite wall. “Watson
won’t allow that I know anything __PREP__ art but that is mere jealousy
because our views upon the subject differ. Now, these are a really very
fine series __PREP__ portraits.”

“Well, I’m glad __PREP__ hear you say so,” said Sir Henry, glancing __PREP__ some
surprise __PREP__ my friend. “I don’t pretend __PREP__ know much __PREP__ these things,
and I’d be a better judge __PREP__ a horse or a steer than __PREP__ a picture. I
didn’t know that you found time __PREP__ such things.”

“I know what is good when I see it, and I see it now. That’s a Kneller,
I’ll swear, that lady __PREP__ the blue silk over yonder, and the stout
gentleman __PREP__ the wig ought __PREP__ be a Reynolds. They are all family
portraits, I presume?”

“Every one.”

“Do you know the names?”

“Barrymore has been coaching me __PREP__ them, and I think I can say my
lessons fairly well.”

“Who is the gentleman __PREP__ the telescope?”

“That is Rear-Admiral Baskerville, who served under Rodney __PREP__ the West
Indies. The man __PREP__ the blue coat and the roll __PREP__ paper is Sir William
Baskerville, who was Chairman __PREP__ Committees __PREP__ the House __PREP__ Commons
under Pitt.”

“And this Cavalier opposite __PREP__ me--the one __PREP__ the black velvet and the
lace?”

“Ah, you have a right __PREP__ know __PREP__ him. That is the cause __PREP__ all the
mischief, the wicked Hugo, who started the Hound __PREP__ the Baskervilles.
We’re not likely __PREP__ forget him.”

I gazed __PREP__ interest and some surprise upon the portrait.

“Dear me!” said Holmes, “he seems a quiet, meek-mannered man enough, but
I dare say that there was a lurking devil __PREP__ his eyes. I had pictured
him as a more robust and ruffianly person.”

“There’s no doubt __PREP__ the authenticity, __PREP__ the name and the date,
1647, are __PREP__ the back __PREP__ the canvas.”

Holmes said little more, but the picture __PREP__ the old roysterer seemed __PREP__
have a fascination __PREP__ him, and his eyes were continually fixed upon it
during supper. It was not until later, when Sir Henry had gone __PREP__ his
room, that I was able __PREP__ follow the trend __PREP__ his thoughts. He led me
back into the banqueting-hall, his bedroom candle __PREP__ his hand, and he
held it up against the time-stained portrait __PREP__ the wall.

“Do you see anything there?”

I looked __PREP__ the broad plumed hat, the curling love-locks, the white lace
collar, and the straight, severe face which was framed between them. It
was not a brutal countenance, but it was prim, hard, and stern, __PREP__ a
firm-set, thin-lipped mouth, and a coldly intolerant eye.

“Is it like anyone you know?”

“There is something __PREP__ Sir Henry __PREP__ the jaw.”

“Just a suggestion, perhaps. But wait an instant!” He stood upon a
chair, and, holding up the light __PREP__ his left hand, he curved his right
arm over the broad hat and round the long ringlets.

“Good heavens!” I cried __PREP__ amazement.

The face __PREP__ Stapleton had sprung out __PREP__ the canvas.

“Ha, you see it now. My eyes have been trained __PREP__ examine faces and not
their trimmings. It is the first quality __PREP__ a criminal investigator that
he should see through a disguise.”

“But this is marvellous. It might be his portrait.”

“Yes, it is an interesting instance __PREP__ a throwback, which appears __PREP__ be
both physical and spiritual. A study __PREP__ family portraits is enough
__PREP__ convert a man __PREP__ the doctrine __PREP__ reincarnation. The fellow is a
Baskerville--that is evident.”

“__PREP__ designs upon the succession.”

“Exactly. This chance __PREP__ the picture has supplied us __PREP__ one __PREP__ our
most obvious missing links. We have him, Watson, we have him, and I dare
swear that before tomorrow night he will be fluttering __PREP__ our net as
helpless as one __PREP__ his own butterflies. A pin, a cork, and a card, and
we add him __PREP__ the Baker Street collection!” He burst into one __PREP__ his
rare fits __PREP__ laughter as he turned away __PREP__ the picture. I have not
heard him laugh often, and it has always boded ill __PREP__ somebody.

I was up betimes __PREP__ the morning, but Holmes was afoot earlier still, __PREP__
I saw him as I dressed, coming up the drive.

“Yes, we should have a full day today,” he remarked, and he rubbed his
hands __PREP__ the joy __PREP__ action. “The nets are all __PREP__ place, and the drag
is __PREP__ __PREP__ begin. We’ll know before the day is out whether we have
caught our big, leanjawed pike, or whether he has got through the
meshes.”

“Have you been __PREP__ the moor already?”

“I have sent a report __PREP__ Grimpen __PREP__ Princetown as __PREP__ the death __PREP__
Selden. I think I can promise that none __PREP__ you will be troubled __PREP__ the
matter. And I have also communicated __PREP__ my faithful Cartwright, who
would certainly have pined away __PREP__ the door __PREP__ my hut, as a dog does __PREP__
his master’s grave, if I had not set his mind __PREP__ rest __PREP__ my safety.”

“What is the next move?”

“__PREP__ see Sir Henry. Ah, here he is!”

“Good-morning, Holmes,” said the baronet. “You look like a general who
is planning a battle __PREP__ his chief __PREP__ the staff.”

“That is the exact situation. Watson was asking __PREP__ orders.”

“And so do I.”

“Very good. You are engaged, as I understand, __PREP__ dine __PREP__ our friends
the Stapletons tonight.”

“I hope that you will come also. They are very hospitable people, and I
am sure that they would be very glad __PREP__ see you.”

“I fear that Watson and I must go __PREP__ London.”

“__PREP__ London?”

“Yes, I think that we should be more useful there __PREP__ the present
juncture.”

The baronet’s face perceptibly lengthened.

“I hoped that you were going __PREP__ see me through this business. The Hall
and the moor are not very pleasant places when one is alone.”

“My dear fellow, you must trust me implicitly and do exactly what I tell
you. You can tell your friends that we should have been happy __PREP__ have
come __PREP__ you, but that urgent business required us __PREP__ be __PREP__ town. We
hope very soon __PREP__ return __PREP__ Devonshire. Will you remember __PREP__ give them
that message?”

“If you insist upon it.”

“There is no alternative, I assure you.”

I saw __PREP__ the baronet’s clouded brow that he was deeply hurt __PREP__ what he
regarded as our desertion.

“When do you desire __PREP__ go?” he asked coldly.

“Immediately after breakfast. We will drive __PREP__ __PREP__ Coombe Tracey, but
Watson will leave his things as a pledge that he will come back __PREP__ you.
Watson, you will send a note __PREP__ Stapleton __PREP__ tell him that you regret
that you cannot come.”

“I have a good mind __PREP__ go __PREP__ London __PREP__ you,” said the baronet. “Why
should I stay here alone?”

“Because it is your post __PREP__ duty. Because you gave me your word that you
would do as you were told, and I tell you __PREP__ stay.”

“All right, then, I’ll stay.”

“One more direction! I wish you __PREP__ drive __PREP__ Merripit House. Send back
your trap, however, and let them know that you intend __PREP__ walk home.”

“__PREP__ walk across the moor?”

“Yes.”

“But that is the very thing which you have so often cautioned me not __PREP__
do.”

“This time you may do it __PREP__ safety. If I had not every confidence __PREP__
your nerve and courage I would not suggest it, but it is essential that
you should do it.”

“Then I will do it.”

“And as you value your life do not go across the moor __PREP__ any direction
save along the straight path which leads __PREP__ Merripit House __PREP__ the
Grimpen Road, and is your natural way home.”

“I will do just what you say.”

“Very good. I should be glad __PREP__ get away as soon after breakfast as
possible, so as __PREP__ reach London __PREP__ the afternoon.”

I was much astounded __PREP__ this programme, though I remembered that Holmes
had said __PREP__ Stapleton __PREP__ the night before that his visit would terminate
next day. It had not crossed my mind however, that he would wish me __PREP__
go __PREP__ him, nor could I understand how we could both be absent __PREP__ a
moment which he himself declared __PREP__ be critical. There was nothing __PREP__
it, however, but implicit obedience; so we bade good-bye __PREP__ our rueful
friend, and a couple __PREP__ hours afterwards we were __PREP__ the station __PREP__
Coombe Tracey and had dispatched the trap upon its return journey. A
small boy was waiting upon the platform.

“Any orders, sir?”

“You will take this train __PREP__ town, Cartwright. The moment you arrive you
will send a wire __PREP__ Sir Henry Baskerville, __PREP__ my name, __PREP__ say that if he
finds the pocketbook which I have dropped he is __PREP__ send it __PREP__ registered
post __PREP__ Baker Street.”

“Yes, sir.”

“And ask __PREP__ the station office if there is a message __PREP__ me.”

The boy returned __PREP__ a telegram, which Holmes handed __PREP__ me. It ran:

Wire received. Coming down __PREP__ unsigned warrant. Arrive five-forty.
Lestrade.

“That is __PREP__ answer __PREP__ mine __PREP__ this morning. He is the best __PREP__ the
professionals, I think, and we may need his assistance. Now, Watson, I
think that we cannot employ our time better than __PREP__ calling upon your
acquaintance, Mrs. Laura Lyons.”

His plan __PREP__ campaign was beginning __PREP__ be evident. He would use the
baronet __PREP__ order __PREP__ convince the Stapletons that we were really gone,
while we should actually return __PREP__ the instant when we were likely __PREP__
be needed. That telegram __PREP__ London, if mentioned __PREP__ Sir Henry __PREP__ the
Stapletons, must remove the last suspicions __PREP__ their minds. Already I
seemed __PREP__ see our nets drawing closer around that leanjawed pike.

Mrs. Laura Lyons was __PREP__ her office, and Sherlock Holmes opened his
interview __PREP__ a frankness and directness which considerably amazed her.

“I am investigating the circumstances which attended the death __PREP__ the
late Sir Charles Baskerville,” said he. “My friend here, Dr. Watson,
has informed me __PREP__ what you have communicated, and also __PREP__ what you have
withheld __PREP__ connection __PREP__ that matter.”

“What have I withheld?” she asked defiantly.

“You have confessed that you asked Sir Charles __PREP__ be __PREP__ the gate __PREP__ ten
o’clock. We know that that was the place and hour __PREP__ his death. You have
withheld what the connection is between these events.”

“There is no connection.”

“__PREP__ that case the coincidence must indeed be an extraordinary one. But
I think that we shall succeed __PREP__ establishing a connection, after all. I
wish __PREP__ be perfectly frank __PREP__ you, Mrs. Lyons. We regard this case as
one __PREP__ murder, and the evidence may implicate not only your friend Mr.
Stapleton but his wife as well.”

The lady sprang __PREP__ her chair.

“His wife!” she cried.

“The fact is no longer a secret. The person who has passed __PREP__ his
sister is really his wife.”

Mrs. Lyons had resumed her seat. Her hands were grasping the arms __PREP__ her
chair, and I saw that the pink nails had turned white __PREP__ the pressure
__PREP__ her grip.

“His wife!” she said again. “His wife! He is not a married man.”

Sherlock Holmes shrugged his shoulders.

“Prove it __PREP__ me! Prove it __PREP__ me! And if you can do so--!”

The fierce flash __PREP__ her eyes said more than any words.

“I have come prepared __PREP__ do so,” said Holmes, drawing several papers
__PREP__ his pocket. “Here is a photograph __PREP__ the couple taken __PREP__ York four
years ago. It is indorsed ‘Mr. and Mrs. Vandeleur,’ but you will have no
difficulty __PREP__ recognizing him, and her also, if you know her __PREP__ sight.
Here are three written descriptions __PREP__ trustworthy witnesses __PREP__ Mr. and
Mrs. Vandeleur, who __PREP__ that time kept St. Oliver’s private school. Read
them and see if you can doubt the identity __PREP__ these people.”

She glanced __PREP__ them, and then looked up __PREP__ us __PREP__ the set, rigid face
__PREP__ a desperate woman.

“Mr. Holmes,” she said, “this man had offered me marriage __PREP__ condition
that I could get a divorce __PREP__ my husband. He has lied __PREP__ me, the
villain, __PREP__ every conceivable way. Not one word __PREP__ truth has he ever
told me. And why--why? I imagined that all was __PREP__ my own sake. But now
I see that I was never anything but a tool __PREP__ his hands. Why should I
preserve faith __PREP__ him who never kept any __PREP__ me? Why should I try __PREP__
shield him __PREP__ the consequences __PREP__ his own wicked acts? Ask me what you
like, and there is nothing which I shall hold back. One thing I swear
__PREP__ you, and that is that when I wrote the letter I never dreamed __PREP__ any
harm __PREP__ the old gentleman, who had been my kindest friend.”

“I entirely believe you, madam,” said Sherlock Holmes. “The recital __PREP__
these events must be very painful __PREP__ you, and perhaps it will make it
easier if I tell you what occurred, and you can check me if I make any
material mistake. The sending __PREP__ this letter was suggested __PREP__ you __PREP__
Stapleton?”

“He dictated it.”

“I presume that the reason he gave was that you would receive help __PREP__
Sir Charles __PREP__ the legal expenses connected __PREP__ your divorce?”

“Exactly.”

“And then after you had sent the letter he dissuaded you __PREP__ keeping
the appointment?”

“He told me that it would hurt his self-respect that any other man
should find the money __PREP__ such an object, and that though he was a poor
man himself he would devote his last penny __PREP__ removing the obstacles
which divided us.”

“He appears __PREP__ be a very consistent character. And then you heard
nothing until you read the reports __PREP__ the death __PREP__ the paper?”

“No.”

“And he made you swear __PREP__ say nothing __PREP__ your appointment __PREP__ Sir
Charles?”

“He did. He said that the death was a very mysterious one, and that I
should certainly be suspected if the facts came out. He frightened me
into remaining silent.”

“Quite so. But you had your suspicions?”

She hesitated and looked down.

“I knew him,” she said. “But if he had kept faith __PREP__ me I should
always have done so __PREP__ him.”

“I think that __PREP__ the whole you have had a fortunate escape,” said
Sherlock Holmes. “You have had him __PREP__ your power and he knew it, and yet
you are alive. You have been walking __PREP__ some months very near __PREP__ the
edge __PREP__ a precipice. We must wish you good-morning now, Mrs. Lyons, and
it is probable that you will very shortly hear __PREP__ us again.”

“Our case becomes rounded off, and difficulty after difficulty thins
away __PREP__ front __PREP__ us,” said Holmes as we stood waiting __PREP__ the arrival __PREP__
the express __PREP__ town. “I shall soon be __PREP__ the position __PREP__ being able
__PREP__ put into a single connected narrative one __PREP__ the most singular
and sensational crimes __PREP__ modern times. Students __PREP__ criminology will
remember the analogous incidents __PREP__ Godno, __PREP__ Little Russia, __PREP__ the year
‘66, and __PREP__ course there are the Anderson murders __PREP__ North Carolina, but
this case possesses some features which are entirely its own. Even now
we have no clear case against this very wily man. But I shall be very
much surprised if it is not clear enough before we go __PREP__ bed this
night.”

The London express came roaring into the station, and a small, wiry
bulldog __PREP__ a man had sprung __PREP__ a first-class carriage. We all three
shook hands, and I saw __PREP__ once __PREP__ the reverential way __PREP__ which
Lestrade gazed __PREP__ my companion that he had learned a good deal since
the days when they had first worked together. I could well remember
the scorn which the theories __PREP__ the reasoner used then __PREP__ excite __PREP__ the
practical man.

“Anything good?” he asked.

“The biggest thing __PREP__ years,” said Holmes. “We have two hours before
we need think __PREP__ starting. I think we might employ it __PREP__ getting some
dinner and then, Lestrade, we will take the London fog out __PREP__ your
throat __PREP__ giving you a breath __PREP__ the pure night air __PREP__ Dartmoor. Never
been there? Ah, well, I don’t suppose you will forget your first visit.”




Chapter 14. The Hound __PREP__ the Baskervilles



One __PREP__ Sherlock Holmes’s defects--if, indeed, one may call it a
defect--was that he was exceedingly loath __PREP__ communicate his full plans
__PREP__ any other person until the instant __PREP__ their fulfilment. Partly it
came no doubt __PREP__ his own masterful nature, which loved __PREP__ dominate and
surprise those who were around him. Partly also __PREP__ his professional
caution, which urged him never __PREP__ take any chances. The result, however,
was very trying __PREP__ those who were acting as his agents and assistants.
I had often suffered under it, but never more so than during that long
drive __PREP__ the darkness. The great ordeal was __PREP__ front __PREP__ us; __PREP__ last we
were __PREP__ __PREP__ make our final effort, and yet Holmes had said nothing,
and I could only surmise what his course __PREP__ action would be. My nerves
thrilled __PREP__ anticipation when __PREP__ last the cold wind upon our faces and
the dark, void spaces __PREP__ either side __PREP__ the narrow road told me that we
were back upon the moor once again. Every stride __PREP__ the horses and every
turn __PREP__ the wheels was taking us nearer __PREP__ our supreme adventure.

Our conversation was hampered __PREP__ the presence __PREP__ the driver __PREP__ the hired
wagonette, so that we were forced __PREP__ talk __PREP__ trivial matters when our
nerves were tense __PREP__ emotion and anticipation. It was a relief __PREP__ me,
after that unnatural restraint, when we __PREP__ last passed Frankland’s
house and knew that we were drawing near __PREP__ the Hall and __PREP__ the scene
__PREP__ action. We did not drive up __PREP__ the door but got down near the gate __PREP__
the avenue. The wagonette was paid off and ordered __PREP__ return __PREP__ Coombe
Tracey forthwith, while we started __PREP__ walk __PREP__ Merripit House.

“Are you armed, Lestrade?”

The little detective smiled. “As long as I have my trousers I have a
hip-pocket, and as long as I have my hip-pocket I have something __PREP__ it.”

“Good! My friend and I are also ready __PREP__ emergencies.”

“You’re mighty close __PREP__ this affair, Mr. Holmes. What’s the game
now?”

“A waiting game.”

“My word, it does not seem a very cheerful place,” said the detective
__PREP__ a shiver, glancing round him __PREP__ the gloomy slopes __PREP__ the hill and
__PREP__ the huge lake __PREP__ fog which lay over the Grimpen Mire. “I see the
lights __PREP__ a house ahead __PREP__ us.”

“That is Merripit House and the end __PREP__ our journey. I must request you
__PREP__ walk __PREP__ tiptoe and not __PREP__ talk above a whisper.”

We moved cautiously along the track as if we were bound __PREP__ the house,
but Holmes halted us when we were __PREP__ two hundred yards __PREP__ it.

“This will do,” said he. “These rocks upon the right make an admirable
screen.”

“We are __PREP__ wait here?”

“Yes, we shall make our little ambush here. Get into this hollow,
Lestrade. You have been inside the house, have you not, Watson? Can you
tell the position __PREP__ the rooms? What are those latticed windows __PREP__ this
end?”

“I think they are the kitchen windows.”

“And the one beyond, which shines so brightly?”

“That is certainly the dining-room.”

“The blinds are up. You know the lie __PREP__ the land best. Creep forward
quietly and see what they are doing--but __PREP__ heaven’s sake don’t let
them know that they are watched!”

I tiptoed down the path and stooped behind the low wall which surrounded
the stunted orchard. Creeping __PREP__ its shadow I reached a point whence I
could look straight through the uncurtained window.

There were only two men __PREP__ the room, Sir Henry and Stapleton. They sat
__PREP__ their profiles towards me __PREP__ either side __PREP__ the round table. Both
__PREP__ them were smoking cigars, and coffee and wine were __PREP__ front __PREP__ them.
Stapleton was talking __PREP__ animation, but the baronet looked pale and
distrait. Perhaps the thought __PREP__ that lonely walk across the ill-omened
moor was weighing heavily upon his mind.

As I watched them Stapleton rose and left the room, while Sir Henry
filled his glass again and leaned back __PREP__ his chair, puffing __PREP__ his
cigar. I heard the creak __PREP__ a door and the crisp sound __PREP__ boots upon
gravel. The steps passed along the path __PREP__ the other side __PREP__ the wall
under which I crouched. Looking over, I saw the naturalist pause __PREP__ the
door __PREP__ an out-house __PREP__ the corner __PREP__ the orchard. A key turned __PREP__
a lock, and as he passed __PREP__ there was a curious scuffling noise __PREP__
within. He was only a minute or so inside, and then I heard the key turn
once more and he passed me and reentered the house. I saw him rejoin his
guest, and I crept quietly back __PREP__ where my companions were waiting __PREP__
tell them what I had seen.

“You say, Watson, that the lady is not there?” Holmes asked when I had
finished my report.

“No.”

“Where can she be, then, since there is no light __PREP__ any other room
except the kitchen?”

“I cannot think where she is.”

I have said that over the great Grimpen Mire there hung a dense, white
fog. It was drifting slowly __PREP__ our direction and banked itself up like a
wall __PREP__ that side __PREP__ us, low but thick and well defined. The moon shone
__PREP__ it, and it looked like a great shimmering ice-field, __PREP__ the heads
__PREP__ the distant tors as rocks borne upon its surface. Holmes’s face
was turned towards it, and he muttered impatiently as he watched its
sluggish drift.

“It’s moving towards us, Watson.”

“Is that serious?”

“Very serious, indeed--the one thing upon earth which could have
disarranged my plans. He can’t be very long, now. It is already ten
o’clock. Our success and even his life may depend upon his coming out
before the fog is over the path.”

The night was clear and fine above us. The stars shone cold and bright,
while a half-moon bathed the whole scene __PREP__ a soft, uncertain light.
Before us lay the dark bulk __PREP__ the house, its serrated roof and
bristling chimneys hard outlined against the silver-spangled sky. Broad
bars __PREP__ golden light __PREP__ the lower windows stretched across the orchard
and the moor. One __PREP__ them was suddenly shut off. The servants had left
the kitchen. There only remained the lamp __PREP__ the dining-room where the
two men, the murderous host and the unconscious guest, still chatted
over their cigars.

Every minute that white woolly plain which covered one-half __PREP__ the moor
was drifting closer and closer __PREP__ the house. Already the first thin
wisps __PREP__ it were curling across the golden square __PREP__ the lighted window.
The farther wall __PREP__ the orchard was already invisible, and the trees
were standing out __PREP__ a swirl __PREP__ white vapour. As we watched it the
fog-wreaths came crawling round both corners __PREP__ the house and rolled
slowly into one dense bank __PREP__ which the upper floor and the roof
floated like a strange ship upon a shadowy sea. Holmes struck his hand
passionately upon the rock __PREP__ front __PREP__ us and stamped his feet __PREP__ his
impatience.

“If he isn’t out __PREP__ a quarter __PREP__ an hour the path will be covered. __PREP__
half an hour we won’t be able __PREP__ see our hands __PREP__ front __PREP__ us.”

“Shall we move farther back upon higher ground?”

“Yes, I think it would be as well.”

So as the fog-bank flowed onward we fell back before it until we were
half a mile __PREP__ the house, and still that dense white sea, __PREP__ the
moon silvering its upper edge, swept slowly and inexorably __PREP__.

“We are going too far,” said Holmes. “We dare not take the chance __PREP__ his
being overtaken before he can reach us. __PREP__ all costs we must hold our
ground where we are.” He dropped __PREP__ his knees and clapped his ear __PREP__ the
ground. “Thank God, I think that I hear him coming.”

A sound __PREP__ quick steps broke the silence __PREP__ the moor. Crouching among
the stones we stared intently __PREP__ the silver-tipped bank __PREP__ front __PREP__ us.
The steps grew louder, and through the fog, as through a curtain, there
stepped the man whom we were awaiting. He looked round him __PREP__ surprise
as he emerged into the clear, starlit night. Then he came swiftly along
the path, passed close __PREP__ where we lay, and went __PREP__ up the long slope
behind us. As he walked he glanced continually over either shoulder,
like a man who is ill __PREP__ ease.

“Hist!” cried Holmes, and I heard the sharp click __PREP__ a cocking pistol.
“Look out! It’s coming!”

There was a thin, crisp, continuous patter __PREP__ somewhere __PREP__ the heart
__PREP__ that crawling bank. The cloud was within fifty yards __PREP__ where we lay,
and we glared __PREP__ it, all three, uncertain what horror was __PREP__ __PREP__ break
__PREP__ the heart __PREP__ it. I was __PREP__ Holmes’s elbow, and I glanced __PREP__ an
instant __PREP__ his face. It was pale and exultant, his eyes shining brightly
__PREP__ the moonlight. But suddenly they started forward __PREP__ a rigid, fixed
stare, and his lips parted __PREP__ amazement. __PREP__ the same instant Lestrade
gave a yell __PREP__ terror and threw himself face downward upon the ground.
I sprang __PREP__ my feet, my inert hand grasping my pistol, my mind paralyzed
__PREP__ the dreadful shape which had sprung out upon us __PREP__ the shadows __PREP__
the fog. A hound it was, an enormous coal-black hound, but not such a
hound as mortal eyes have ever seen. Fire burst __PREP__ its open mouth, its
eyes glowed __PREP__ a smouldering glare, its muzzle and hackles and dewlap
were outlined __PREP__ flickering flame. Never __PREP__ the delirious dream __PREP__
a disordered brain could anything more savage, more appalling, more
hellish be conceived than that dark form and savage face which broke
upon us out __PREP__ the wall __PREP__ fog.

__PREP__ long bounds the huge black creature was leaping down the track,
following hard upon the footsteps __PREP__ our friend. So paralyzed were we __PREP__
the apparition that we allowed him __PREP__ pass before we had recovered our
nerve. Then Holmes and I both fired together, and the creature gave a
hideous howl, which showed that one __PREP__ least had hit him. He did not
pause, however, but bounded onward. Far away __PREP__ the path we saw Sir
Henry looking back, his face white __PREP__ the moonlight, his hands raised __PREP__
horror, glaring helplessly __PREP__ the frightful thing which was hunting him
down. But that cry __PREP__ pain __PREP__ the hound had blown all our fears __PREP__ the
winds. If he was vulnerable he was mortal, and if we could wound him we
could kill him. Never have I seen a man run as Holmes ran that night. I
am reckoned fleet __PREP__ foot, but he outpaced me as much as I outpaced the
little professional. __PREP__ front __PREP__ us as we flew up the track we heard
scream after scream __PREP__ Sir Henry and the deep roar __PREP__ the hound. I was
__PREP__ time __PREP__ see the beast spring upon its victim, hurl him __PREP__ the ground,
and worry __PREP__ his throat. But the next instant Holmes had emptied five
barrels __PREP__ his revolver into the creature’s flank. __PREP__ a last howl __PREP__
agony and a vicious snap __PREP__ the air, it rolled upon its back, four feet
pawing furiously, and then fell limp upon its side. I stooped, panting,
and pressed my pistol __PREP__ the dreadful, shimmering head, but it was
useless __PREP__ press the trigger. The giant hound was dead.

Sir Henry lay insensible where he had fallen. We tore away his collar,
and Holmes breathed a prayer __PREP__ gratitude when we saw that there was
no sign __PREP__ a wound and that the rescue had been __PREP__ time. Already our
friend’s eyelids shivered and he made a feeble effort __PREP__ move. Lestrade
thrust his brandy-flask between the baronet’s teeth, and two frightened
eyes were looking up __PREP__ us.

“My God!” he whispered. “What was it? What, __PREP__ heaven’s name, was it?”

“It’s dead, whatever it is,” said Holmes. “We’ve laid the family ghost
once and forever.”

__PREP__ mere size and strength it was a terrible creature which was lying
stretched before us. It was not a pure bloodhound and it was not a pure
mastiff; but it appeared __PREP__ be a combination __PREP__ the two--gaunt, savage,
and as large as a small lioness. Even now __PREP__ the stillness __PREP__ death,
the huge jaws seemed __PREP__ be dripping __PREP__ a bluish flame and the small,
deep-set, cruel eyes were ringed __PREP__ fire. I placed my hand upon the
glowing muzzle, and as I held them up my own fingers smouldered and
gleamed __PREP__ the darkness.

“Phosphorus,” I said.

“A cunning preparation __PREP__ it,” said Holmes, sniffing __PREP__ the dead animal.
“There is no smell which might have interfered __PREP__ his power __PREP__ scent.
We owe you a deep apology, Sir Henry, __PREP__ having exposed you __PREP__ this
fright. I was prepared __PREP__ a hound, but not __PREP__ such a creature as this.
And the fog gave us little time __PREP__ receive him.”

“You have saved my life.”

“Having first endangered it. Are you strong enough __PREP__ stand?”

“Give me another mouthful __PREP__ that brandy and I shall be ready __PREP__
anything. So! Now, if you will help me up. What do you propose __PREP__ do?”

“__PREP__ leave you here. You are not fit __PREP__ further adventures tonight. If
you will wait, one or other __PREP__ us will go back __PREP__ you __PREP__ the Hall.”

He tried __PREP__ stagger __PREP__ his feet; but he was still ghastly pale and
trembling __PREP__ every limb. We helped him __PREP__ a rock, where he sat shivering
__PREP__ his face buried __PREP__ his hands.

“We must leave you now,” said Holmes. “The rest __PREP__ our work must be
done, and every moment is __PREP__ importance. We have our case, and now we
only want our man.

“It’s a thousand __PREP__ one against our finding him __PREP__ the house,” he
continued as we retraced our steps swiftly down the path. “Those shots
must have told him that the game was up.”

“We were some distance off, and this fog may have deadened them.”

“He followed the hound __PREP__ call him off--__PREP__ that you may be certain. No,
no, he’s gone __PREP__ this time! But we’ll search the house and make sure.”

The front door was open, so we rushed __PREP__ and hurried __PREP__ room __PREP__
room __PREP__ the amazement __PREP__ a doddering old manservant, who met us __PREP__ the
passage. There was no light save __PREP__ the dining-room, but Holmes caught
up the lamp and left no corner __PREP__ the house unexplored. No sign could we
see __PREP__ the man whom we were chasing. __PREP__ the upper floor, however, one __PREP__
the bedroom doors was locked.

“There’s someone __PREP__ here,” cried Lestrade. “I can hear a movement. Open
this door!”

A faint moaning and rustling came __PREP__ within. Holmes struck the door
just over the lock __PREP__ the flat __PREP__ his foot and it flew open. Pistol __PREP__
hand, we all three rushed into the room.

But there was no sign within it __PREP__ that desperate and defiant villain
whom we expected __PREP__ see. Instead we were faced __PREP__ an object so strange
and so unexpected that we stood __PREP__ a moment staring __PREP__ it __PREP__ amazement.

The room had been fashioned into a small museum, and the walls were
lined __PREP__ a number __PREP__ glass-topped cases full __PREP__ that collection __PREP__
butterflies and moths the formation __PREP__ which had been the relaxation __PREP__
this complex and dangerous man. __PREP__ the centre __PREP__ this room there was an
upright beam, which had been placed __PREP__ some period as a support __PREP__ the
old worm-eaten baulk __PREP__ timber which spanned the roof. __PREP__ this post a
figure was tied, so swathed and muffled __PREP__ the sheets which had been
used __PREP__ secure it that one could not __PREP__ the moment tell whether it
was that __PREP__ a man or a woman. One towel passed round the throat and was
secured __PREP__ the back __PREP__ the pillar. Another covered the lower part __PREP__
the face, and over it two dark eyes--eyes full __PREP__ grief and shame and a
dreadful questioning--stared back __PREP__ us. __PREP__ a minute we had torn off
the gag, unswathed the bonds, and Mrs. Stapleton sank upon the floor __PREP__
front __PREP__ us. As her beautiful head fell upon her chest I saw the clear
red weal __PREP__ a whiplash across her neck.

“The brute!” cried Holmes. “Here, Lestrade, your brandy-bottle! Put her
__PREP__ the chair! She has fainted __PREP__ ill-usage and exhaustion.”

She opened her eyes again.

“Is he safe?” she asked. “Has he escaped?”

“He cannot escape us, madam.”

“No, no, I did not mean my husband. Sir Henry? Is he safe?”

“Yes.”

“And the hound?”

“It is dead.”

She gave a long sigh __PREP__ satisfaction.

“Thank God! Thank God! Oh, this villain! See how he has treated me!”
 She shot her arms out __PREP__ her sleeves, and we saw __PREP__ horror that they
were all mottled __PREP__ bruises. “But this is nothing--nothing! It is my
mind and soul that he has tortured and defiled. I could endure it all,
ill-usage, solitude, a life __PREP__ deception, everything, as long as I could
still cling __PREP__ the hope that I had his love, but now I know that __PREP__
this also I have been his dupe and his tool.” She broke into passionate
sobbing as she spoke.

“You bear him no good will, madam,” said Holmes. “Tell us then where we
shall find him. If you have ever aided him __PREP__ evil, help us now and so
atone.”

“There is but one place where he can have fled,” she answered. “There is
an old tin mine __PREP__ an island __PREP__ the heart __PREP__ the mire. It was there that
he kept his hound and there also he had made preparations so that he
might have a refuge. That is where he would fly.”

The fog-bank lay like white wool against the window. Holmes held the
lamp towards it.

“See,” said he. “No one could find his way into the Grimpen Mire
tonight.”

She laughed and clapped her hands. Her eyes and teeth gleamed __PREP__
fierce merriment.

“He may find his way __PREP__, but never out,” she cried. “How can he see the
guiding wands tonight? We planted them together, he and I, __PREP__ mark the
pathway through the mire. Oh, if I could only have plucked them out
today. Then indeed you would have had him __PREP__ your mercy!”

It was evident __PREP__ us that all pursuit was __PREP__ vain until the fog had
lifted. Meanwhile we left Lestrade __PREP__ possession __PREP__ the house while
Holmes and I went back __PREP__ the baronet __PREP__ Baskerville Hall. The story
__PREP__ the Stapletons could no longer be withheld __PREP__ him, but he took
the blow bravely when he learned the truth __PREP__ the woman whom he had
loved. But the shock __PREP__ the night’s adventures had shattered his nerves,
and before morning he lay delirious __PREP__ a high fever under the care __PREP__
Dr. Mortimer. The two __PREP__ them were destined __PREP__ travel together round the
world before Sir Henry had become once more the hale, hearty man that he
had been before he became master __PREP__ that ill-omened estate.

And now I come rapidly __PREP__ the conclusion __PREP__ this singular narrative, __PREP__
which I have tried __PREP__ make the reader share those dark fears and vague
surmises which clouded our lives so long and ended __PREP__ so tragic a
manner. __PREP__ the morning after the death __PREP__ the hound the fog had lifted
and we were guided __PREP__ Mrs. Stapleton __PREP__ the point where they had found
a pathway through the bog. It helped us __PREP__ realize the horror __PREP__ this
woman’s life when we saw the eagerness and joy __PREP__ which she laid us
__PREP__ her husband’s track. We left her standing upon the thin peninsula __PREP__
firm, peaty soil which tapered out into the widespread bog. __PREP__ the
end __PREP__ it a small wand planted here and there showed where the path
zigzagged __PREP__ tuft __PREP__ tuft __PREP__ rushes among those green-scummed pits
and foul quagmires which barred the way __PREP__ the stranger. Rank reeds and
lush, slimy water-plants sent an odour __PREP__ decay and a heavy miasmatic
vapour onto our faces, while a false step plunged us more than once
thigh-deep into the dark, quivering mire, which shook __PREP__ yards __PREP__ soft
undulations around our feet. Its tenacious grip plucked __PREP__ our heels as
we walked, and when we sank into it it was as if some malignant hand was
tugging us down into those obscene depths, so grim and purposeful was
the clutch __PREP__ which it held us. Once only we saw a trace that someone
had passed that perilous way before us. __PREP__ amid a tuft __PREP__ cotton grass
which bore it up out __PREP__ the slime some dark thing was projecting. Holmes
sank __PREP__ his waist as he stepped __PREP__ the path __PREP__ seize it, and had we
not been there __PREP__ drag him out he could never have set his foot
upon firm land again. He held an old black boot __PREP__ the air. “Meyers,
Toronto,” was printed __PREP__ the leather inside.

“It is worth a mud bath,” said he. “It is our friend Sir Henry’s missing
boot.”

“Thrown there __PREP__ Stapleton __PREP__ his flight.”

“Exactly. He retained it __PREP__ his hand after using it __PREP__ set the hound
upon the track. He fled when he knew the game was up, still clutching
it. And he hurled it away __PREP__ this point __PREP__ his flight. We know __PREP__ least
that he came so far __PREP__ safety.”

But more than that we were never destined __PREP__ know, though there was much
which we might surmise. There was no chance __PREP__ finding footsteps __PREP__ the
mire, __PREP__ the rising mud oozed swiftly __PREP__ upon them, but as we __PREP__ last
reached firmer ground beyond the morass we all looked eagerly __PREP__ them.
But no slightest sign __PREP__ them ever met our eyes. If the earth told a
true story, then Stapleton never reached that island __PREP__ refuge towards
which he struggled through the fog upon that last night. Somewhere __PREP__
the heart __PREP__ the great Grimpen Mire, down __PREP__ the foul slime __PREP__ the
huge morass which had sucked him __PREP__, this cold and cruel-hearted man is
forever buried.

Many traces we found __PREP__ him __PREP__ the bog-girt island where he had hid his
savage ally. A huge driving-wheel and a shaft half-filled __PREP__ rubbish
showed the position __PREP__ an abandoned mine. Beside it were the crumbling
remains __PREP__ the cottages __PREP__ the miners, driven away no doubt __PREP__ the foul
reek __PREP__ the surrounding swamp. __PREP__ one __PREP__ these a staple and chain __PREP__
a quantity __PREP__ gnawed bones showed where the animal had been confined.
A skeleton __PREP__ a tangle __PREP__ brown hair adhering __PREP__ it lay among the
debris.

“A dog!” said Holmes. “__PREP__ Jove, a curly-haired spaniel. Poor Mortimer
will never see his pet again. Well, I do not know that this place
contains any secret which we have not already fathomed. He could hide
his hound, but he could not hush its voice, and hence came those cries
which even __PREP__ daylight were not pleasant __PREP__ hear. __PREP__ an emergency he
could keep the hound __PREP__ the out-house __PREP__ Merripit, but it was always a
risk, and it was only __PREP__ the supreme day, which he regarded as the end
__PREP__ all his efforts, that he dared do it. This paste __PREP__ the tin is no
doubt the luminous mixture __PREP__ which the creature was daubed. It was
suggested, __PREP__ course, __PREP__ the story __PREP__ the family hell-hound, and __PREP__ the
desire __PREP__ frighten old Sir Charles __PREP__ death. No wonder the poor devil __PREP__
a convict ran and screamed, even as our friend did, and as we ourselves
might have done, when he saw such a creature bounding through the
darkness __PREP__ the moor upon his track. It was a cunning device, __PREP__, apart
__PREP__ the chance __PREP__ driving your victim __PREP__ his death, what peasant would
venture __PREP__ inquire too closely into such a creature should he get sight
__PREP__ it, as many have done, upon the moor? I said it __PREP__ London, Watson,
and I say it again now, that never yet have we helped __PREP__ hunt down a
more dangerous man than he who is lying yonder”--he swept his long arm
towards the huge mottled expanse __PREP__ green-splotched bog which stretched
away until it merged into the russet slopes __PREP__ the moor.




Chapter 15. A Retrospection



It was the end __PREP__ November, and Holmes and I sat, upon a raw and foggy
night, __PREP__ either side __PREP__ a blazing fire __PREP__ our sitting-room __PREP__ Baker
Street. Since the tragic upshot __PREP__ our visit __PREP__ Devonshire he had been
engaged __PREP__ two affairs __PREP__ the utmost importance, __PREP__ the first __PREP__ which
he had exposed the atrocious conduct __PREP__ Colonel Upwood __PREP__ connection
__PREP__ the famous card scandal __PREP__ the Nonpareil Club, while __PREP__ the second
he had defended the unfortunate Mme. Montpensier __PREP__ the charge
__PREP__ murder which hung over her __PREP__ connection __PREP__ the death __PREP__ her
step-daughter, Mlle. Carere, the young lady who, as it will be
remembered, was found six months later alive and married __PREP__ New York.
My friend was __PREP__ excellent spirits over the success which had attended
a succession __PREP__ difficult and important cases, so that I was able __PREP__
induce him __PREP__ discuss the details __PREP__ the Baskerville mystery. I had
waited patiently __PREP__ the opportunity __PREP__ I was aware that he would never
permit cases __PREP__ overlap, and that his clear and logical mind would not
be drawn __PREP__ its present work __PREP__ dwell upon memories __PREP__ the past. Sir
Henry and Dr. Mortimer were, however, __PREP__ London, __PREP__ their way __PREP__ that
long voyage which had been recommended __PREP__ the restoration __PREP__ his
shattered nerves. They had called upon us that very afternoon, so that
it was natural that the subject should come up __PREP__ discussion.

“The whole course __PREP__ events,” said Holmes, “__PREP__ the point __PREP__ view __PREP__
the man who called himself Stapleton was simple and direct, although
__PREP__ us, who had no means __PREP__ the beginning __PREP__ knowing the motives __PREP__
his actions and could only learn part __PREP__ the facts, it all appeared
exceedingly complex. I have had the advantage __PREP__ two conversations __PREP__
Mrs. Stapleton, and the case has now been so entirely cleared up that I
am not aware that there is anything which has remained a secret __PREP__ us.
You will find a few notes upon the matter under the heading B __PREP__ my
indexed list __PREP__ cases.”

“Perhaps you would kindly give me a sketch __PREP__ the course __PREP__ events __PREP__
memory.”

“Certainly, though I cannot guarantee that I carry all the facts __PREP__ my
mind. Intense mental concentration has a curious way __PREP__ blotting out
what has passed. The barrister who has his case __PREP__ his fingers’ ends and
is able __PREP__ argue __PREP__ an expert upon his own subject finds that a week
or two __PREP__ the courts will drive it all out __PREP__ his head once more. So
each __PREP__ my cases displaces the last, and Mlle. Carere has blurred my
recollection __PREP__ Baskerville Hall. Tomorrow some other little problem may
be submitted __PREP__ my notice which will __PREP__ turn dispossess the fair French
lady and the infamous Upwood. So far as the case __PREP__ the hound goes,
however, I will give you the course __PREP__ events as nearly as I can, and
you will suggest anything which I may have forgotten.

“My inquiries show beyond all question that the family portrait did not
lie, and that this fellow was indeed a Baskerville. He was a son __PREP__ that
Rodger Baskerville, the younger brother __PREP__ Sir Charles, who fled __PREP__
a sinister reputation __PREP__ South America, where he was said __PREP__ have died
unmarried. He did, as a matter __PREP__ fact, marry, and had one child, this
fellow, whose real name is the same as his father’s. He married Beryl
Garcia, one __PREP__ the beauties __PREP__ Costa Rica, and, having purloined a
considerable sum __PREP__ public money, he changed his name __PREP__ Vandeleur and
fled __PREP__ England, where he established a school __PREP__ the east __PREP__ Yorkshire.
His reason __PREP__ attempting this special line __PREP__ business was that he had
struck up an acquaintance __PREP__ a consumptive tutor upon the voyage
home, and that he had used this man’s ability __PREP__ make the undertaking a
success. Fraser, the tutor, died however, and the school which had begun
well sank __PREP__ disrepute into infamy. The Vandeleurs found it convenient
__PREP__ change their name __PREP__ Stapleton, and he brought the remains __PREP__ his
fortune, his schemes __PREP__ the future, and his taste __PREP__ entomology __PREP__
the south __PREP__ England. I learned __PREP__ the British Museum that he was a
recognized authority upon the subject, and that the name __PREP__ Vandeleur
has been permanently attached __PREP__ a certain moth which he had, __PREP__ his
Yorkshire days, been the first __PREP__ describe.

“We now come __PREP__ that portion __PREP__ his life which has proved __PREP__ be __PREP__ such
intense interest __PREP__ us. The fellow had evidently made inquiry and found
that only two lives intervened between him and a valuable estate. When
he went __PREP__ Devonshire his plans were, I believe, exceedingly hazy, but
that he meant mischief __PREP__ the first is evident __PREP__ the way __PREP__ which
he took his wife __PREP__ him __PREP__ the character __PREP__ his sister. The idea __PREP__
using her as a decoy was clearly already __PREP__ his mind, though he may not
have been certain how the details __PREP__ his plot were __PREP__ be arranged. He
meant __PREP__ the end __PREP__ have the estate, and he was ready __PREP__ use any tool
or run any risk __PREP__ that end. His first act was __PREP__ establish himself as
near __PREP__ his ancestral home as he could, and his second was __PREP__ cultivate
a friendship __PREP__ Sir Charles Baskerville and __PREP__ the neighbours.

“The baronet himself told him __PREP__ the family hound, and so prepared
the way __PREP__ his own death. Stapleton, as I will continue __PREP__ call him,
knew that the old man’s heart was weak and that a shock would kill him.
So much he had learned __PREP__ Dr. Mortimer. He had heard also that Sir
Charles was superstitious and had taken this grim legend very seriously.
His ingenious mind instantly suggested a way __PREP__ which the baronet could
be done __PREP__ death, and yet it would be hardly possible __PREP__ bring home the
guilt __PREP__ the real murderer.

“Having conceived the idea he proceeded __PREP__ carry it out __PREP__
considerable finesse. An ordinary schemer would have been content
__PREP__ work __PREP__ a savage hound. The use __PREP__ artificial means __PREP__ make the
creature diabolical was a flash __PREP__ genius upon his part. The dog he
bought __PREP__ London __PREP__ Ross and Mangles, the dealers __PREP__ Fulham Road. It
was the strongest and most savage __PREP__ their possession. He brought it
down __PREP__ the North Devon line and walked a great distance over the moor
so as __PREP__ get it home without exciting any remarks. He had already __PREP__ his
insect hunts learned __PREP__ penetrate the Grimpen Mire, and so had found a
safe hiding-place __PREP__ the creature. Here he kennelled it and waited his
chance.

“But it was some time coming. The old gentleman could not be decoyed
outside __PREP__ his grounds __PREP__ night. Several times Stapleton lurked __PREP__
__PREP__ his hound, but without avail. It was during these fruitless quests
that he, or rather his ally, was seen __PREP__ peasants, and that the legend
__PREP__ the demon dog received a new confirmation. He had hoped that his wife
might lure Sir Charles __PREP__ his ruin, but here she proved unexpectedly
independent. She would not endeavour __PREP__ entangle the old gentleman __PREP__
a sentimental attachment which might deliver him over __PREP__ his enemy.
Threats and even, I am sorry __PREP__ say, blows refused __PREP__ move her. She
would have nothing __PREP__ do __PREP__ it, and __PREP__ a time Stapleton was __PREP__ a
deadlock.

“He found a way out __PREP__ his difficulties through the chance that Sir
Charles, who had conceived a friendship __PREP__ him, made him the minister
__PREP__ his charity __PREP__ the case __PREP__ this unfortunate woman, Mrs. Laura Lyons.
__PREP__ representing himself as a single man he acquired complete influence
over her, and he gave her __PREP__ understand that __PREP__ the event __PREP__ her
obtaining a divorce __PREP__ her husband he would marry her. His plans were
suddenly brought __PREP__ a head __PREP__ his knowledge that Sir Charles was __PREP__
__PREP__ leave the Hall __PREP__ the advice __PREP__ Dr. Mortimer, __PREP__ whose opinion he
himself pretended __PREP__ coincide. He must act __PREP__ once, or his victim might
get beyond his power. He therefore put pressure upon Mrs. Lyons __PREP__
write this letter, imploring the old man __PREP__ give her an interview __PREP__
the evening before his departure __PREP__ London. He then, __PREP__ a specious
argument, prevented her __PREP__ going, and so had the chance __PREP__ which he
had waited.

“Driving back __PREP__ the evening __PREP__ Coombe Tracey he was __PREP__ time __PREP__ get
his hound, __PREP__ treat it __PREP__ his infernal paint, and __PREP__ bring the beast
round __PREP__ the gate __PREP__ which he had reason __PREP__ expect that he would find
the old gentleman waiting. The dog, incited __PREP__ its master, sprang over
the wicket-gate and pursued the unfortunate baronet, who fled screaming
down the yew alley. __PREP__ that gloomy tunnel it must indeed have been a
dreadful sight __PREP__ see that huge black creature, __PREP__ its flaming jaws
and blazing eyes, bounding after its victim. He fell dead __PREP__ the end
__PREP__ the alley __PREP__ heart disease and terror. The hound had kept upon the
grassy border while the baronet had run down the path, so that no track
but the man’s was visible. __PREP__ seeing him lying still the creature had
probably approached __PREP__ sniff __PREP__ him, but finding him dead had turned
away again. It was then that it left the print which was actually
observed __PREP__ Dr. Mortimer. The hound was called off and hurried away __PREP__
its lair __PREP__ the Grimpen Mire, and a mystery was left which puzzled
the authorities, alarmed the countryside, and finally brought the case
within the scope __PREP__ our observation.

“So much __PREP__ the death __PREP__ Sir Charles Baskerville. You perceive the
devilish cunning __PREP__ it, __PREP__ really it would be almost impossible __PREP__ make
a case against the real murderer. His only accomplice was one who could
never give him away, and the grotesque, inconceivable nature __PREP__
the device only served __PREP__ make it more effective. Both __PREP__ the women
concerned __PREP__ the case, Mrs. Stapleton and Mrs. Laura Lyons, were left
__PREP__ a strong suspicion against Stapleton. Mrs. Stapleton knew that he
had designs upon the old man, and also __PREP__ the existence __PREP__ the hound.
Mrs. Lyons knew neither __PREP__ these things, but had been impressed __PREP__ the
death occurring __PREP__ the time __PREP__ an uncancelled appointment which was only
known __PREP__ him. However, both __PREP__ them were under his influence, and he had
nothing __PREP__ fear __PREP__ them. The first half __PREP__ his task was successfully
accomplished but the more difficult still remained.

“It is possible that Stapleton did not know __PREP__ the existence __PREP__ an heir
__PREP__ Canada. __PREP__ any case he would very soon learn it __PREP__ his friend Dr.
Mortimer, and he was told __PREP__ the latter all details __PREP__ the arrival __PREP__
Henry Baskerville. Stapleton’s first idea was that this young stranger
__PREP__ Canada might possibly be done __PREP__ death __PREP__ London without coming
down __PREP__ Devonshire __PREP__ all. He distrusted his wife ever since she had
refused __PREP__ help him __PREP__ laying a trap __PREP__ the old man, and he dared not
leave her long out __PREP__ his sight __PREP__ fear he should lose his influence
over her. It was __PREP__ this reason that he took her __PREP__ London __PREP__ him.
They lodged, I find, __PREP__ the Mexborough Private Hotel, __PREP__ Craven Street,
which was actually one __PREP__ those called upon __PREP__ my agent __PREP__ search
__PREP__ evidence. Here he kept his wife imprisoned __PREP__ her room while
he, disguised __PREP__ a beard, followed Dr. Mortimer __PREP__ Baker Street and
afterwards __PREP__ the station and __PREP__ the Northumberland Hotel. His wife had
some inkling __PREP__ his plans; but she had such a fear __PREP__ her husband--a
fear founded upon brutal ill-treatment--that she dare not write __PREP__ warn
the man whom she knew __PREP__ be __PREP__ danger. If the letter should fall into
Stapleton’s hands her own life would not be safe. Eventually, as we
know, she adopted the expedient __PREP__ cutting out the words which would
form the message, and addressing the letter __PREP__ a disguised hand. It
reached the baronet, and gave him the first warning __PREP__ his danger.

“It was very essential __PREP__ Stapleton __PREP__ get some article __PREP__ Sir Henry’s
attire so that, __PREP__ case he was driven __PREP__ use the dog, he might always
have the means __PREP__ setting him upon his track. __PREP__ characteristic
promptness and audacity he set __PREP__ this __PREP__ once, and we cannot doubt
that the boots or chamber-maid __PREP__ the hotel was well bribed __PREP__ help him
__PREP__ his design. __PREP__ chance, however, the first boot which was procured __PREP__
him was a new one and, therefore, useless __PREP__ his purpose. He then had
it returned and obtained another--a most instructive incident, since it
proved conclusively __PREP__ my mind that we were dealing __PREP__ a real hound,
as no other supposition could explain this anxiety __PREP__ obtain an old
boot and this indifference __PREP__ a new one. The more outre and grotesque an
incident is the more carefully it deserves __PREP__ be examined, and the very
point which appears __PREP__ complicate a case is, when duly considered and
scientifically handled, the one which is most likely __PREP__ elucidate it.

“Then we had the visit __PREP__ our friends next morning, shadowed always
__PREP__ Stapleton __PREP__ the cab. __PREP__ his knowledge __PREP__ our rooms and __PREP__ my
appearance, as well as __PREP__ his general conduct, I am inclined __PREP__ think
that Stapleton’s career __PREP__ crime has been __PREP__ no means limited __PREP__ this
single Baskerville affair. It is suggestive that during the last three
years there have been four considerable burglaries __PREP__ the west country,
__PREP__ none __PREP__ which was any criminal ever arrested. The last __PREP__ these, __PREP__
Folkestone Court, __PREP__ May, was remarkable __PREP__ the cold-blooded pistolling
__PREP__ the page, who surprised the masked and solitary burglar. I cannot
doubt that Stapleton recruited his waning resources __PREP__ this fashion, and
that __PREP__ years he has been a desperate and dangerous man.

“We had an example __PREP__ his readiness __PREP__ resource that morning when he got
away __PREP__ us so successfully, and also __PREP__ his audacity __PREP__ sending back
my own name __PREP__ me through the cabman. __PREP__ that moment he understood
that I had taken over the case __PREP__ London, and that therefore there was
no chance __PREP__ him there. He returned __PREP__ Dartmoor and awaited the arrival
__PREP__ the baronet.”

“One moment!” said I. “You have, no doubt, described the sequence
__PREP__ events correctly, but there is one point which you have left
unexplained. What became __PREP__ the hound when its master was __PREP__ London?”

“I have given some attention __PREP__ this matter and it is undoubtedly __PREP__
importance. There can be no question that Stapleton had a confidant,
though it is unlikely that he ever placed himself __PREP__ his power __PREP__
sharing all his plans __PREP__ him. There was an old manservant __PREP__ Merripit
House, whose name was Anthony. His connection __PREP__ the Stapletons can
be traced __PREP__ several years, as far back as the school-mastering days,
so that he must have been aware that his master and mistress were really
husband and wife. This man has disappeared and has escaped __PREP__ the
country. It is suggestive that Anthony is not a common name __PREP__ England,
while Antonio is so __PREP__ all Spanish or Spanish-American countries. The
man, like Mrs. Stapleton herself, spoke good English, but __PREP__ a curious
lisping accent. I have myself seen this old man cross the Grimpen
Mire __PREP__ the path which Stapleton had marked out. It is very probable,
therefore, that __PREP__ the absence __PREP__ his master it was he who cared __PREP__ the
hound, though he may never have known the purpose __PREP__ which the beast
was used.

“The Stapletons then went down __PREP__ Devonshire, whither they were soon
followed __PREP__ Sir Henry and you. One word now as __PREP__ how I stood myself __PREP__
that time. It may possibly recur __PREP__ your memory that when I examined
the paper upon which the printed words were fastened I made a close
inspection __PREP__ the water-mark. __PREP__ doing so I held it within a few inches
__PREP__ my eyes, and was conscious __PREP__ a faint smell __PREP__ the scent known as
white jessamine. There are seventy-five perfumes, which it is very
necessary that a criminal expert should be able __PREP__ distinguish __PREP__ each
other, and cases have more than once within my own experience depended
upon their prompt recognition. The scent suggested the presence __PREP__ a
lady, and already my thoughts began __PREP__ turn towards the Stapletons. Thus
I had made certain __PREP__ the hound, and had guessed __PREP__ the criminal before
ever we went __PREP__ the west country.

“It was my game __PREP__ watch Stapleton. It was evident, however, that I
could not do this if I were __PREP__ you, since he would be keenly __PREP__ his
guard. I deceived everybody, therefore, yourself included, and I came
down secretly when I was supposed __PREP__ be __PREP__ London. My hardships were
not so great as you imagined, though such trifling details must never
interfere __PREP__ the investigation __PREP__ a case. I stayed __PREP__ the most
part __PREP__ Coombe Tracey, and only used the hut upon the moor when it was
necessary __PREP__ be near the scene __PREP__ action. Cartwright had come down __PREP__
me, and __PREP__ his disguise as a country boy he was __PREP__ great assistance
__PREP__ me. I was dependent upon him __PREP__ food and clean linen. When I was
watching Stapleton, Cartwright was frequently watching you, so that I
was able __PREP__ keep my hand upon all the strings.

“I have already told you that your reports reached me rapidly, being
forwarded instantly __PREP__ Baker Street __PREP__ Coombe Tracey. They were __PREP__
great service __PREP__ me, and especially that one incidentally truthful piece
__PREP__ biography __PREP__ Stapleton’s. I was able __PREP__ establish the identity __PREP__
the man and the woman and knew __PREP__ last exactly how I stood. The case
had been considerably complicated through the incident __PREP__ the escaped
convict and the relations between him and the Barrymores. This also you
cleared up __PREP__ a very effective way, though I had already come __PREP__ the
same conclusions __PREP__ my own observations.

“__PREP__ the time that you discovered me upon the moor I had a complete
knowledge __PREP__ the whole business, but I had not a case which could go __PREP__
a jury. Even Stapleton’s attempt upon Sir Henry that night which ended
__PREP__ the death __PREP__ the unfortunate convict did not help us much __PREP__ proving
murder against our man. There seemed __PREP__ be no alternative but __PREP__
catch him red-handed, and __PREP__ do so we had __PREP__ use Sir Henry, alone and
apparently unprotected, as a bait. We did so, and __PREP__ the cost __PREP__ a
severe shock __PREP__ our client we succeeded __PREP__ completing our case and
driving Stapleton __PREP__ his destruction. That Sir Henry should have been
exposed __PREP__ this is, I must confess, a reproach __PREP__ my management __PREP__ the
case, but we had no means __PREP__ foreseeing the terrible and paralyzing
spectacle which the beast presented, nor could we predict the fog which
enabled him __PREP__ burst upon us __PREP__ such short notice. We succeeded __PREP__ our
object __PREP__ a cost which both the specialist and Dr. Mortimer assure me
will be a temporary one. A long journey may enable our friend __PREP__ recover
not only __PREP__ his shattered nerves but also __PREP__ his wounded feelings.
His love __PREP__ the lady was deep and sincere, and __PREP__ him the saddest part
__PREP__ all this black business was that he should have been deceived __PREP__ her.

“It only remains __PREP__ indicate the part which she had played throughout.
There can be no doubt that Stapleton exercised an influence over her
which may have been love or may have been fear, or very possibly both,
since they are __PREP__ no means incompatible emotions. It was, __PREP__ least,
absolutely effective. __PREP__ his command she consented __PREP__ pass as his
sister, though he found the limits __PREP__ his power over her when he
endeavoured __PREP__ make her the direct accessory __PREP__ murder. She was ready __PREP__
warn Sir Henry so far as she could without implicating her husband, and
again and again she tried __PREP__ do so. Stapleton himself seems __PREP__ have been
capable __PREP__ jealousy, and when he saw the baronet paying court __PREP__ the
lady, even though it was part __PREP__ his own plan, still he could not help
interrupting __PREP__ a passionate outburst which revealed the fiery soul
which his self-contained manner so cleverly concealed. __PREP__ encouraging
the intimacy he made it certain that Sir Henry would frequently come
__PREP__ Merripit House and that he would sooner or later get the opportunity
which he desired. __PREP__ the day __PREP__ the crisis, however, his wife turned
suddenly against him. She had learned something __PREP__ the death __PREP__ the
convict, and she knew that the hound was being kept __PREP__ the outhouse __PREP__
the evening that Sir Henry was coming __PREP__ dinner. She taxed her husband
__PREP__ his intended crime, and a furious scene followed __PREP__ which he showed
her __PREP__ the first time that she had a rival __PREP__ his love. Her fidelity
turned __PREP__ an instant __PREP__ bitter hatred, and he saw that she would betray
him. He tied her up, therefore, that she might have no chance __PREP__ warning
Sir Henry, and he hoped, no doubt, that when the whole countryside put
down the baronet’s death __PREP__ the curse __PREP__ his family, as they certainly
would do, he could win his wife back __PREP__ accept an accomplished fact and
__PREP__ keep silent upon what she knew. __PREP__ this I fancy that __PREP__ any case
he made a miscalculation, and that, if we had not been there, his doom
would none the less have been sealed. A woman __PREP__ Spanish blood does
not condone such an injury so lightly. And now, my dear Watson, without
referring __PREP__ my notes, I cannot give you a more detailed account __PREP__
this curious case. I do not know that anything essential has been left
unexplained.”

“He could not hope __PREP__ frighten Sir Henry __PREP__ death as he had done the old
uncle __PREP__ his bogie hound.”

“The beast was savage and half-starved. If its appearance did not
frighten its victim __PREP__ death, __PREP__ least it would paralyze the resistance
which might be offered.”

“No doubt. There only remains one difficulty. If Stapleton came into the
succession, how could he explain the fact that he, the heir, had been
living unannounced under another name so close __PREP__ the property? How
could he claim it without causing suspicion and inquiry?”

“It is a formidable difficulty, and I fear that you ask too much when
you expect me __PREP__ solve it. The past and the present are within the field
__PREP__ my inquiry, but what a man may do __PREP__ the future is a hard question
__PREP__ answer. Mrs. Stapleton has heard her husband discuss the problem __PREP__
several occasions. There were three possible courses. He might claim the
property __PREP__ South America, establish his identity before the British
authorities there and so obtain the fortune without ever coming __PREP__
England __PREP__ all, or he might adopt an elaborate disguise during the
short time that he need be __PREP__ London; or, again, he might furnish an
accomplice __PREP__ the proofs and papers, putting him __PREP__ as heir, and
retaining a claim upon some proportion __PREP__ his income. We cannot doubt
__PREP__ what we know __PREP__ him that he would have found some way out __PREP__ the
difficulty. And now, my dear Watson, we have had some weeks __PREP__ severe
work, and __PREP__ one evening, I think, we may turn our thoughts into more
pleasant channels. I have a box __PREP__ ‘Les Huguenots.’ Have you heard the
De Reszkes? Might I trouble you then __PREP__ be ready __PREP__ half an hour, and we
can stop __PREP__ Marcini’s __PREP__ a little dinner __PREP__ the way?”

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm’s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
