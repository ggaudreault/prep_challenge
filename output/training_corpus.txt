Department </s> </s> <s> 2 </s> CHAPTER I </s> MR </s> SHERLOCK HOLMES </s> IN the year 1878 I took my degree of Doctor of Medicine of the University of London and proceeded to Netley to go through the course prescribed for surgeon in the army </s> Having completed my study there I wa duly attached to the Fifth Northumberland Fusiliers a Assistant Surgeon </s> The regiment wa stationed in India at the time and before I could join it the second Afghan war had broken out </s> On landing at Bombay I learned that my corp had advanced through the pass and wa already deep in the enemy’s country </s> I followed however with many other officer who were in the same situation a myself and succeeded in reaching Candahar in safety where I found my regiment and at once entered upon my new duty </s> The campaign brought honour and promotion to many but for me it had nothing but misfortune and disaster </s> I wa removed from my brigade and attached to the Berkshires with whom I served at the fatal battle of Maiwand </s> There I wa struck on the shoulder by a Jezail bullet which shattered the bone and grazed the subclavian artery </s> I should have fallen into the hand of the murderous Ghazis had it not been for the devotion and courage shown by Murray my orderly who threw me across a pack horse and succeeded in bringing me safely to the British line </s> Worn with pain and weak from the prolonged hardship which I had undergone I wa removed with a great train of wounded sufferer to the base hospital at Peshawar </s> Here I rallied and had already improved so far a to be able to walk about the ward and even to bask a little upon the verandah when I wa struck down by enteric fever that curse of our Indian possession </s> For month my life wa despaired of and when at last I came to myself and became convalescent I wa so weak and emaciated that a medical board determined that not a day should be lost in sending me back to England </s> I wa dispatched accordingly in the troopship <s> Orontes </s> and landed a month later on Portsmouth jetty with my health irretrievably ruined but with permission from a paternal government to spend the next nine month in attempting to improve it </s> I had neither kith nor kin in England and wa therefore a free a air</s> <s>or a free a an income of eleven shilling and sixpence a day will permit a man to be </s> Under such circumstance I naturally gravitated to London that great cesspool into which all the lounger and idler of the Empire are irresistibly drained </s> There I stayed for some time at a private hotel in the Strand leading a comfortless meaningless existence and spending such money a I had considerably more freely than I ought </s> So alarming did the state of my finance become that I soon realized that I must either leave the metropolis and rusticate somewhere in the country or that I must make a complete alteration in my style of living </s> Choosing the latter alternative I began by making up my mind to leave the hotel and to take up my quarter in some le pretentious and le expensive domicile </s> On the very day that I had come to this conclusion I wa standing at the Criterion Bar when some one tapped me on the shoulder and turning round I recognized young Stamford who had been a dresser under me at Barts </s> The sight of a friendly face in the great wilderness of London is a pleasant thing indeed to a lonely man </s> In old day Stamford had never been a particular crony of mine but now I hailed him with enthusiasm and he in his turn appeared to be delighted to see me </s> In the exuberance of my joy I asked him to lunch with me at the Holborn and we started off together in a hansom </s> <s> Whatever have you been doing with yourself Watson </s> </s> he asked in undisguised wonder a we rattled through the crowded London street </s> <s> You are a thin a a lath and a brown a a nut </s> </s> I gave him a short sketch of my adventure and had hardly concluded it by the time that we reached our destination </s> <s> Poor devil </s> </s> he said commiseratingly after he had listened to my misfortune </s> <s> What are you up to now </s> </s> <s> Looking for lodging </s> </s> <s> 3 </s> I answered </s> <s> Trying to solve the problem a to whether it is possible to get comfortable room at a reasonable price </s> </s> <s> That’s a strange thing </s> remarked my companion</s> <s> <s> you are the second man to day that ha used that expression to me </s> </s> <s> And who wa the first </s> </s> I asked </s> <s> A fellow who is working at the chemical laboratory up at the hospital </s> He wa bemoaning himself this morning because he could not get someone to go half with him in some nice room which he had found and which were too much for his purse </s> </s> <s> By Jove </s> </s> I cried <s> if he really want someone to share the room and the expense I am the very man for him </s> I should prefer having a partner to being alone </s> </s> Young Stamford looked rather strangely at me over his wine glass </s> <s> You don’t know Sherlock Holmes yet </s> he said</s> <s> <s> perhaps you would not care for him a a constant companion </s> </s> <s> Why what is there against him </s> </s> <s> Oh I didn’t say there wa anything against him </s> He is a little queer in his ideas</s> <s>an enthusiast in some branch of science </s> As far a I know he is a decent fellow enough </s> </s> <s> A medical student I suppose </s> </s> said I </s> <s> No</s> <s>I have no idea what he intends to go in for </s> I believe he is well up in anatomy and he is a first class chemist</s> <s> but a far a I know he ha never taken out any systematic medical class </s> His study are very desultory and eccentric but he ha amassed a lot of out of the way knowledge which would astonish his professor </s> </s> <s> Did you never ask him what he wa going in for </s> </s> I asked </s> <s> No</s> <s> he is not a man that it is easy to draw out though he can be communicative enough when the fancy seizes him </s> </s> <s> I should like to meet him </s> I said </s> <s> If I am to lodge with anyone I should prefer a man of studious and quiet habit </s> I am not strong enough yet to stand much noise or excitement </s> I had enough of both in Afghanistan to last me for the remainder of my natural existence </s> How could I meet this friend of yours </s> </s> <s> He is sure to be at the laboratory </s> returned my companion </s> <s> He either avoids the place for week or else he work there from morning to night </s> If you like we shall drive round together after luncheon </s> </s> <s> Certainly </s> I answered and the conversation drifted away into other channel </s> As we made our way to the hospital after leaving the Holborn Stamford gave me a few more particular about the gentleman whom I proposed to take a a fellow lodger </s> <s> You mustn’t blame me if you don’t get on with him </s> he said</s> <s> <s> I know nothing more of him than I have learned from meeting him occasionally in the laboratory </s> You proposed this arrangement so you must not hold me responsible </s> </s> <s> If we don’t get on it will be easy to part company </s> I answered </s> <s> It seems to me Stamford </s> I added looking hard at my companion <s> that you have some reason for washing your hand of the matter </s> Is this fellow’s temper so formidable or what is it </s> Don’t be mealy mouthed about it </s> </s> <s> It is not easy to express the inexpressible </s> he answered with a laugh </s> <s> Holmes is a little too scientific for my tastes</s> <s>it approach to cold bloodedness </s> I could imagine his giving a friend a little pinch of the latest vegetable alkaloid not out of malevolence you understand but simply out of a spirit of inquiry in order to have an accurate idea of the effect </s> To do him justice I think that he would take it himself with the same readiness </s> He appears to have a passion for definite and exact knowledge </s> </s> <s> Very right too </s> </s> <s> Yes but it may be pushed to excess </s> When it come to beating the subject in the dissecting room with a stick it is certainly taking rather a bizarre shape </s> </s> <s> Beating the subject </s> </s> <s> Yes to verify how far bruise may be produced after death </s> I saw him at it with my own eye </s> </s> <s> And yet you say he is not a medical student </s> </s> <s> No </s> Heaven know what the object of his study are </s> But here we are and you must form your own impression about him </s> </s> As he spoke we turned down a narrow lane and passed through a small side door which opened into a wing of the great hospital </s> It wa familiar ground to me and I needed no guiding a we ascended the bleak stone staircase and made our way down the long corridor with it vista of whitewashed wall and dun coloured door </s> Near the further end a low arched passage branched away from it and led to the chemical laboratory </s> This wa a lofty chamber lined and littered with countless bottle </s> Broad low table were scattered about which bristled with retort test tube and little Bunsen lamp with their blue flickering flame </s> There wa only one student in the room who wa bending over a distant table absorbed in his work </s> At the sound of our step he glanced round and sprang to his foot with a cry of pleasure </s> <s> I’ve found it </s> I’ve found it </s> he shouted to my companion running towards u with a test tube in his hand </s> <s> I have found a re agent which is precipitated by hoemoglobin <s> 4 </s> and by nothing else </s> </s> Had he discovered a gold mine greater delight could not have shone upon his feature </s> <s> Dr </s> Watson Mr </s> Sherlock Holmes </s> said Stamford introducing u </s> <s> How are you </s> </s> he said cordially gripping my hand with a strength for which I should hardly have given him credit </s> <s> You have been in Afghanistan I perceive </s> </s> <s> How on earth did you know that </s> </s> I asked in astonishment </s> <s> Never mind </s> said he chuckling to himself </s> <s> The question now is about hoemoglobin </s> No doubt you see the significance of this discovery of mine </s> </s> <s> It is interesting chemically no doubt </s> I answered <s> but practically</s> <s></s> <s> </s> <s> Why man it is the most practical medico legal discovery for year </s> Don’t you see that it give u an infallible test for blood stain </s> Come over here now </s> </s> He seized me by the coat sleeve in his eagerness and drew me over to the table at which he had been working </s> <s> Let u have some fresh blood </s> he said digging a long bodkin into his finger and drawing off the resulting drop of blood in a chemical pipette </s> <s> Now I add this small quantity of blood to a litre of water </s> You perceive that the resulting mixture ha the appearance of pure water </s> The proportion of blood cannot be more than one in a million </s> I have no doubt however that we shall be able to obtain the characteristic reaction </s> </s> As he spoke he threw into the vessel a few white crystal and then added some drop of a transparent fluid </s> In an instant the content assumed a dull mahogany colour and a brownish dust wa precipitated to the bottom of the glass jar </s> <s> Ha </s> ha </s> </s> he cried clapping his hand and looking a delighted a a child with a new toy </s> <s> What do you think of that </s> </s> <s> It seems to be a very delicate test </s> I remarked </s> <s> Beautiful </s> beautiful </s> The old Guiacum test wa very clumsy and uncertain </s> So is the microscopic examination for blood corpuscle </s> The latter is valueless if the stain are a few hour old </s> Now this appears to act a well whether the blood is old or new </s> Had this test been invented there are hundred of men now walking the earth who would long ago have paid the penalty of their crime </s> </s> <s> Indeed </s> </s> I murmured </s> <s> Criminal case are continually hinging upon that one point </s> A man is suspected of a crime month perhaps after it ha been committed </s> His linen or clothes are examined and brownish stain discovered upon them </s> Are they blood stain or mud stain or rust stain or fruit stain or what are they </s> That is a question which ha puzzled many an expert and why </s> Because there wa no reliable test </s> Now we have the Sherlock Holmes’ test and there will no longer be any difficulty </s> </s> His eye fairly glittered a he spoke and he put his hand over his heart and bowed a if to some applauding crowd conjured up by his imagination </s> <s> You are to be congratulated </s> I remarked considerably surprised at his enthusiasm </s> <s> There wa the case of Von Bischoff at Frankfort last year </s> He would certainly have been hung had this test been in existence </s> Then there wa Mason of Bradford and the notorious Muller and Lefevre of Montpellier and Samson of New Orleans </s> I could name a score of case in which it would have been decisive </s> </s> <s> You seem to be a walking calendar of crime </s> said Stamford with a laugh </s> <s> You might start a paper on those line </s> Call it the ‘Police News of the Past </s> ’ </s> <s> Very interesting reading it might be made too </s> remarked Sherlock Holmes sticking a small piece of plaster over the prick on his finger </s> <s> I have to be careful </s> he continued turning to me with a smile <s> for I dabble with poison a good deal </s> </s> He held out his hand a he spoke and I noticed that it wa all mottled over with similar piece of plaster and discoloured with strong acid </s> <s> We came here on business </s> said Stamford sitting down on a high three legged stool and pushing another one in my direction with his foot </s> <s> My friend here want to take digging and a you were complaining that you could get no one to go half with you I thought that I had better bring you together </s> </s> Sherlock Holmes seemed delighted at the idea of sharing his room with me </s> <s> I have my eye on a suite in Baker Street </s> he said <s> which would suit u down to the ground </s> You don’t mind the smell of strong tobacco I hope </s> </s> <s> I always smoke ‘ship’s’ myself </s> I answered </s> <s> That’s good enough </s> I generally have chemical about and occasionally do experiment </s> Would that annoy you </s> </s> <s> By no mean </s> </s> <s> Let me see</s> <s>what are my other shortcoming </s> I get in the dump at time and don’t open my mouth for day on end </s> You must not think I am sulky when I do that </s> Just let me alone and I’ll soon be right </s> What have you to confess now </s> It’s just a well for two fellow to know the worst of one another before they begin to live together </s> </s> I laughed at this cross examination </s> <s> I keep a bull pup </s> I said <s> and I object to row because my nerve are shaken and I get up at all sort of ungodly hour and I am extremely lazy </s> I have another set of vice when I’m well but those are the principal one at present </s> </s> <s> Do you include violin playing in your category of row </s> </s> he asked anxiously </s> <s> It depends on the player </s> I answered </s> <s> A well played violin is a treat for the gods</s> <s>a badly played one</s> <s></s> <s> </s> <s> Oh that’s all right </s> he cried with a merry laugh </s> <s> I think we may consider the thing a settled</s> <s>that is if the room are agreeable to you </s> </s> <s> When shall we see them </s> </s> <s> Call for me here at noon to morrow and we’ll go together and settle everything </s> he answered </s> <s> All right</s> <s>noon exactly </s> said I shaking his hand </s> We left him working among his chemical and we walked together towards my hotel </s> <s> By the way </s> I asked suddenly stopping and turning upon Stamford <s> how the deuce did he know that I had come from Afghanistan </s> </s> My companion smiled an enigmatical smile </s> <s> That’s just his little peculiarity </s> he said </s> <s> A good many people have wanted to know how he find thing out </s> </s> <s> Oh </s> a mystery is it </s> </s> I cried rubbing my hand </s> <s> This is very piquant </s> I am much obliged to you for bringing u together </s> ‘The proper study of mankind is man ’ you know </s> </s> <s> You must study him then </s> Stamford said a he bade me good bye </s> <s> You’ll find him a knotty problem though </s> I’ll wager he learns more about you than you about him </s> Good bye </s> </s> <s> Good bye </s> I answered and strolled on to my hotel considerably interested in my new acquaintance </s> CHAPTER II </s> THE SCIENCE OF DEDUCTION </s> WE met next day a he had arranged and inspected the room at No </s> 221B <s> 5 </s> Baker Street of which he had spoken at our meeting </s> They consisted of a couple of comfortable bed room and a single large airy sitting room cheerfully furnished and illuminated by two broad window </s> So desirable in every way were the apartment and so moderate did the term seem when divided between u that the bargain wa concluded upon the spot and we at once entered into possession </s> That very evening I moved my thing round from the hotel and on the following morning Sherlock Holmes followed me with several box and portmanteau </s> For a day or two we were busily employed in unpacking and laying out our property to the best advantage </s> That done we gradually began to settle down and to accommodate ourselves to our new surroundings </s> Holmes wa certainly not a difficult man to live with </s> He wa quiet in his way and his habit were regular </s> It wa rare for him to be up after ten at night and he had invariably breakfasted and gone out before I rose in the morning </s> Sometimes he spent his day at the chemical laboratory sometimes in the dissecting room and occasionally in long walk which appeared to take him into the lowest portion of the City </s> Nothing could exceed his energy when the working fit wa upon him</s> <s> but now and again a reaction would seize him and for day on end he would lie upon the sofa in the sitting room hardly uttering a word or moving a muscle from morning to night </s> On these occasion I have noticed such a dreamy vacant expression in his eye that I might have suspected him of being addicted to the use of some narcotic had not the temperance and cleanliness of his whole life forbidden such a notion </s> As the week went by my interest in him and my curiosity a to his aim in life gradually deepened and increased </s> His very person and appearance were such a to strike the attention of the most casual observer </s> In height he wa rather over six foot and so excessively lean that he seemed to be considerably taller </s> His eye were sharp and piercing save during those interval of torpor to which I have alluded</s> <s> and his thin hawk like nose gave his whole expression an air of alertness and decision </s> His chin too had the prominence and squareness which mark the man of determination </s> His hand were invariably blotted with ink and stained with chemical yet he wa possessed of extraordinary delicacy of touch a I frequently had occasion to observe when I watched him manipulating his fragile philosophical instrument </s> The reader may set me down a a hopeless busybody when I confess how much this man stimulated my curiosity and how often I endeavoured to break through the reticence which he showed on all that concerned himself </s> Before pronouncing judgment however be it remembered how objectless wa my life and how little there wa to engage my attention </s> My health forbade me from venturing out unless the weather wa exceptionally genial and I had no friend who would call upon me and break the monotony of my daily existence </s> Under these circumstance I eagerly hailed the little mystery which hung around my companion and spent much of my time in endeavouring to unravel it </s> He wa not studying medicine </s> He had himself in reply to a question confirmed Stamford’s opinion upon that point </s> Neither did he appear to have pursued any course of reading which might fit him for a degree in science or any other recognized portal which would give him an entrance into the learned world </s> Yet his zeal for certain study wa remarkable and within eccentric limit his knowledge wa so extraordinarily ample and minute that his observation have fairly astounded me </s> Surely no man would work so hard or attain such precise information unless he had some definite end in view </s> Desultory reader are seldom remarkable for the exactness of their learning </s> No man burden his mind with small matter unless he ha some very good reason for doing so </s> His ignorance wa a remarkable a his knowledge </s> Of contemporary literature philosophy and politics he appeared to know next to nothing </s> Upon my quoting Thomas Carlyle he inquired in the naivest way who he might be and what he had done </s> My surprise reached a climax however when I found incidentally that he wa ignorant of the Copernican Theory and of the composition of the Solar System </s> That any civilized human being in this nineteenth century should not be aware that the earth travelled round the sun appeared to be to me such an extraordinary fact that I could hardly realize it </s> <s> You appear to be astonished </s> he said smiling at my expression of surprise </s> <s> Now that I do know it I shall do my best to forget it </s> </s> <s> To forget it </s> </s> <s> You see </s> he explained <s> I consider that a man’s brain originally is like a little empty attic and you have to stock it with such furniture a you choose </s> A fool take in all the lumber of every sort that he come across so that the knowledge which might be useful to him get crowded out or at best is jumbled up with a lot of other thing so that he ha a difficulty in laying his hand upon it </s> Now the skilful workman is very careful indeed a to what he take into his brain attic </s> He will have nothing but the tool which may help him in doing his work but of these he ha a large assortment and all in the most perfect order </s> It is a mistake to think that that little room ha elastic wall and can distend to any extent </s> Depend upon it there come a time when for every addition of knowledge you forget something that you knew before </s> It is of the highest importance therefore not to have useless fact elbowing out the useful one </s> </s> <s> But the Solar System </s> </s> I protested </s> <s> What the deuce is it to me </s> </s> he interrupted impatiently</s> <s> <s> you say that we go round the sun </s> If we went round the moon it would not make a pennyworth of difference to me or to my work </s> </s> I wa on the point of asking him what that work might be but something in his manner showed me that the question would be an unwelcome one </s> I pondered over our short conversation however and endeavoured to draw my deduction from it </s> He said that he would acquire no knowledge which did not bear upon his object </s> Therefore all the knowledge which he possessed wa such a would be useful to him </s> I enumerated in my own mind all the various point upon which he had shown me that he wa exceptionally well informed </s> I even took a pencil and jotted them down </s> I could not help smiling at the document when I had completed it </s> It ran in this way</s> <s> SHERLOCK HOLMES</s> <s>his limit </s> 1 </s> Knowledge of Literature </s> <s>Nil </s> 2 </s>

by reconciling all these accomplishment and discovering a calling which need them all </s> I said to myself <s> I may a well give up the attempt at once </s> </s> I see that I have alluded above to his power upon the violin </s> These were very remarkable but a eccentric a all his other accomplishment </s> That he could play piece and difficult piece I knew well because at my request he ha played me some of Mendelssohn’s Lieder and other favourite </s> When left to himself however he would seldom produce any music or attempt any recognized air </s> Leaning back in his arm chair of an evening he would close his eye and scrape carelessly at the fiddle which wa thrown across his knee </s> Sometimes the chord were sonorous and melancholy </s> Occasionally they were fantastic and cheerful </s> Clearly they reflected the thought which possessed him but whether the music aided those thought or whether the playing wa simply the result of a whim or fancy wa more than I could determine </s> I might have rebelled against these exasperating solo had it not been that he usually terminated them by playing in quick succession a whole series of my favourite air a a slight compensation for the trial upon my patience </s> During the first week or so we had no caller and I had begun to think that my companion wa a friendless a man a I wa myself </s> Presently however I found that he had many acquaintance and those in the most different class of society </s> There wa one little sallow rat faced dark eyed fellow who wa introduced to me a Mr </s> Lestrade and who came three or four time in a single week </s> One morning a young girl called fashionably dressed and stayed for half an hour or more </s> The same afternoon brought a grey headed seedy visitor looking like a Jew pedlar who appeared to me to be much excited and who wa closely followed by a slip shod elderly woman </s> On another occasion an old white haired gentleman had an interview with my companion</s> <s> and on another a railway porter in his velveteen uniform </s> When any of these nondescript individual put in an appearance Sherlock Holmes used to beg for the use of the sitting room and I would retire to my bed room </s> He always apologized to me for putting me to this inconvenience </s> <s> I have to use this room a a place of business </s> he said <s> and these people are my client </s> </s> Again I had an opportunity of asking him a point blank question and again my delicacy prevented me from forcing another man to confide in me </s> I imagined at the time that he had some strong reason for not alluding to it but he soon dispelled the idea by coming round to the subject of his own accord </s> It wa upon the 4th of March a I have good reason to remember that I rose somewhat earlier than usual and found that Sherlock Holmes had not yet finished his breakfast </s> The landlady had become so accustomed to my late habit that my place had not been laid nor my coffee prepared </s> With the unreasonable petulance of mankind I rang the bell and gave a curt intimation that I wa ready </s> Then I picked up a magazine from the table and attempted to while away the time with it while my companion munched silently at his toast </s> One of the article had a pencil mark at the heading and I naturally began to run my eye through it </s> Its somewhat ambitious title wa <s> The Book of Life </s> and it attempted to show how much an observant man might learn by an accurate and systematic examination of all that came in his way </s> It struck me a being a remarkable mixture of shrewdness and of absurdity </s> The reasoning wa close and intense but the deduction appeared to me to be far fetched and exaggerated </s> The writer claimed by a momentary expression a twitch of a muscle or a glance of an eye to fathom a man’s inmost thought </s> Deceit according to him wa an impossibility in the case of one trained to observation and analysis </s> His conclusion were a infallible a so many proposition of Euclid </s> So startling would his result appear to the uninitiated that until they learned the process by which he had arrived at them they might well consider him a a necromancer </s> <s> From a drop of water </s> said the writer <s> a logician could infer the possibility of an Atlantic or a Niagara without having seen or heard of one or the other </s> So all life is a great chain the nature of which is known whenever we are shown a single link of it </s> Like all other art the Science of Deduction and Analysis is one which can only be acquired by long and patient study nor is life long enough to allow any mortal to attain the highest possible perfection in it </s> Before turning to those moral and mental aspect of the matter which present the greatest difficulty let the enquirer begin by mastering more elementary problem </s> Let him on meeting a fellow mortal learn at a glance to distinguish the history of the man and the trade or profession to which he belongs </s> Puerile a such an exercise may seem it sharpens the faculty of observation and teach one where to look and what to look for </s> By a man’s finger nail by his coat

But do you mean to say </s> I said <s> that without leaving your room you can unravel some knot which other men can make nothing of although they have seen every detail for themselves </s> </s> <s> Quite so </s> I have a kind of intuition that way </s> Now and again a case turn up which is a little more complex </s> Then I have to bustle about and see thing with my own eye </s> You see I have a lot of special knowledge which I apply to the problem and which facilitates matter wonderfully </s> Those rule of deduction laid down in that article which aroused your scorn are invaluable to me in practical work </s> Observation with me is second nature </s> You appeared to be surprised when I told you on our first meeting that you had come from Afghanistan </s> </s> <s> You were told no doubt </s> </s> <s> Nothing of the sort </s> I knew you came from Afghanistan </s> From long habit the train of thought ran so swiftly through my mind that I arrived at the conclusion without being conscious of intermediate step </s> There were such step however </s> The train of reasoning ran ‘Here is a gentleman of a medical type but with the air of a military man </s> Clearly an army doctor then </s> He ha just come from the tropic for his face is dark and that is not the natural tint of his skin for his wrist are fair </s> He ha undergone hardship and sickness a his haggard face say clearly </s> His left arm ha been injured </s> He hold it in a stiff and unnatural manner </s> Where in the tropic could an English army doctor have seen much hardship and got his arm wounded </s> Clearly in Afghanistan </s> ’ The whole train of thought did not occupy a second </s> I then remarked that you came from Afghanistan and you were astonished </s> </s> <s> It is simple enough a you

match on his boot and held it up against the wall </s> <s> Look at that </s> </s> he said triumphantly </s> I have remarked that the paper had fallen away in part </s> In this particular corner of the

measure and a large round magnifying glass from his pocket </s> With these two implement he trotted noiselessly about the room sometimes stopping occasionally kneeling and once lying flat upon his face </s> So engrossed wa he with his occupation that he appeared to have forgotten our presence for he chattered away to himself under his breath the whole time keeping up a running fire of exclamation groan whistle and little cry suggestive of encouragement and of hope </s> As I watched him I wa irresistibly reminded of a pure blooded well trained foxhound a it dash backwards and forward through the covert whining in it eagerness until it come across the lost scent </s> For twenty minute or more he continued his research measuring with the most exact care the distance between mark which were entirely invisible to me and occasionally applying his tape to the wall in an equally incomprehensible manner </s> In one place he gathered up very carefully a little pile of grey dust from the floor and packed it away in an envelope </s> Finally he examined with his glass the word upon the wall going over every letter of it with the most minute exactness </s> This done he appeared to be satisfied for he replaced his tape and his glass in his pocket </s> <s> They say that genius is an infinite capacity for taking pain </s> he remarked with a smile </s> <s> It’s a very bad

</s> <s> There’s no room for a mistake </s> he answered </s> <s> The very first thing which I observed on arriving there wa that a cab had made two rut with it wheel close to the curb </s> Now up to last night we have had no rain for a week so that those wheel which left such a deep impression must have been there during the night </s> There were the mark of the horse’s hoof too the outline of one of which wa far more clearly cut than that of the other three showing that that wa a new shoe </s> Since the cab wa there after the rain began and wa not there at any time during the morning</s> <s>I have Gregson’s word for that</s> <s>it follows that it must have been there during the night and therefore that it brought those two individual to the house </s> </s> <s> That seems simple enough </s> said I</s> <s> <s> but how about the other man’s height </s> </s> <s> Why the height of a man in nine case out of ten can be told from the length of his stride </s> It is a simple calculation enough though there is no use my boring you with figure </s> I had this fellow’s stride both on the clay outside and on the dust within </s> Then I had a way of checking my calculation </s> When a man writes on a wall his instinct lead him to write about the level of his own eye </s> Now that writing wa just over six foot from the ground </s> It wa child’s play </s> </s> <s> And his age </s> </s> I asked </s> <s> Well if a man can stride four and a half foot without the smallest effort he can’t be quite in the sere and yellow </s> That wa the breadth of a puddle on the garden walk which he had

writing on the wall wa done with a man’s forefinger dipped in blood </s> My glass allowed me to observe that the plaster wa slightly scratched in doing it which would not have been the case if the man’s nail had been trimmed </s> I gathered up some scattered ash from the floor </s> It wa dark in colour and flakey</s> <s>such an ash a is only made by a Trichinopoly </s> I have made a special study of cigar ashes</s> <s>in fact I have written a monograph upon the subject </s> I flatter myself that I can distinguish at a glance the ash of any known brand either of cigar or of tobacco </s> It is just in such detail that the skilled detective differs from the Gregson and Lestrade type </s> </s> <s> And the florid face </s> </s> I asked </s> <s> Ah that wa a more daring shot though I have no doubt that I wa right </s> You must not ask me that at the present state of the affair </s> </s> I passed my hand over my brow </s> <s> My head is in a whirl </s> I remarked</s> <s> <s> the more

to Liverpool giving a description of the man and warning them to keep a watch upon the American boat </s> I then set to work calling upon all the hotel and lodging house in the vicinity of Euston </s>

Nothing </s> Stangerson had Drebber’s purse in his pocket but it seems that this wa usual a he did all the paying </s> There wa eighty odd pound in it but nothing had been taken </s> Whatever the

Precisely so </s> answered Holmes </s> <s> Now would you mind going down and fetching that poor little devil of a terrier which ha been bad so long and which the landlady wanted you to put out of it

correct </s> It seemed to me that the mist in my own mind were gradually clearing away and I began to have a dim vague perception of the truth </s> <s> All this seems strange to you </s> continued Holmes <s> because you failed at the beginning of the inquiry to grasp the importance of the single real clue which wa presented to you </s> I had the good fortune to seize upon that and everything

upon the garden gate or the railing </s> With all his vigilance John Ferrier could not discover whence these daily warning proceeded </s> A horror which wa almost superstitious came upon him at the sight of them </s> He became haggard and restless and his eye had the troubled look of some hunted creature </s> He had but one hope in life now and that wa for the arrival of the young hunter from Nevada </s> Twenty had changed to fifteen and fifteen to ten but there wa no news of the absentee </s> One by one the number dwindled down and still there came no sign of him </s> Whenever a horseman clattered down the road or a driver shouted at his team the old farmer hurried to the gate thinking that help had arrived at last </s> At last when he saw five give way to four and that again to three

happen then </s> All manner of vague and terrible fancy filled his imagination </s> And his daughter</s> <s>what wa to become of her after he wa gone </s> Was there no escape from the invisible

<s>low but very distinct in the quiet of the night </s> It came from the door of the house </s> Ferrier crept into the hall and listened intently </s> There wa a pause for a few moment and then the low insidious sound wa repeated </s> Someone wa evidently tapping very gently upon one of the panel of the door </s> Was it some midnight assassin who had come to carry out the murderous order of the secret tribunal </s> Or wa it some agent who wa marking up that the last day of grace had arrived </s> John Ferrier felt that instant death would be better than the suspense which shook his nerve and chilled his heart </s> Springing forward he drew the bolt and threw the door open </s> Outside all wa calm and quiet </s> The night wa fine and the star were twinkling brightly overhead </s> The little front garden lay before the farmer’s eye bounded by the fence and gate but neither there nor on the road wa any human being to be seen </s> With a sigh of relief Ferrier looked to right and to left until happening to glance straight down at his own foot he saw to his astonishment a man lying flat upon his face upon the ground with arm and leg all asprawl </s> So unnerved wa he at the sight that he leaned up against the wall with his hand to his throat to stifle his inclination to call out </s> His first thought wa that the prostrate figure wa that of some wounded or dying man but a he watched it he saw it writhe along the ground and into the hall with the rapidity and noiselessness of a serpent </s> Once within the house the man sprang to his foot closed the door and revealed to the astonished farmer the fierce face and resolute expression of Jefferson Hope </s> <s> Good God </s> </s> gasped John Ferrier </s> <s> How you scared me </s> Whatever made you come in like that </s> </s> <s> Give me food </s> the other said hoarsely </s> <s> I have had no time for bite or sup for eight and forty hour </s> </s> He flung himself upon the <s> 21 </s> cold meat and bread which were

You’re a man to be proud of </s> he said </s> <s> There are not many who would come to share our danger and our trouble </s> </s> <s> You’ve hit it there pard </s> the young hunter answered </s> <s> I

for Carson City through the mountain </s> You had best wake Lucy </s> It is a well that the servant do not sleep in the house </s> </s> While Ferrier wa absent preparing his daughter for the approaching journey Jefferson Hope packed all the eatable that he could find into a small parcel and filled a stoneware jar with water for he knew by experience that the mountain well were few and far between </s> He had hardly completed his arrangement before the farmer returned with his daughter all dressed and ready for a start </s> The greeting between the lover wa warm but brief for minute were precious and there wa much to be done </s> <s> We must make our start at once </s> said Jefferson Hope speaking in a low but resolute voice like one who realizes the greatness of the peril but ha steeled his heart to meet it </s> <s> The front and back entrance are watched but with caution we may get away through the side window and across the field </s> Once on the road we are only two mile from the Ravine where the horse are waiting </s> By daybreak we should be half way through the mountain </s> </s> <s> What if we are stopped </s> asked Ferrier </s> Hope slapped the revolver butt which protruded from the front of his tunic </s> <s> If they are too many for u we shall take two or three of them with u </s> he said with a sinister smile </s> The light inside the house had all been extinguished and from the darkened window Ferrier peered over the field which had been his own and which he wa now about to abandon for ever </s> He had long nerved himself to the sacrifice however and the thought of the honour and happiness of his daughter outweighed any regret at his ruined fortune </s> All looked so peaceful and happy the rustling tree and the broad silent stretch of grain land that it wa difficult to realize that the spirit of murder lurked through it all </s> Yet the white face and set expression of the young hunter showed that in his approach to the house he had seen enough to satisfy him upon that head </s> Ferrier carried the bag of gold and note Jefferson Hope had the scanty provision and water while Lucy had a small bundle containing a few of her more valued possession </s> Opening the window very slowly and carefully they waited until a dark cloud had somewhat obscured the night and then one by one passed through into the little garden </s> With bated breath and crouching figure they stumbled across it and gained the shelter of the hedge which they skirted until they came to the gap which opened into the cornfield </s> They had just reached this point when the young man seized his two companion and dragged them down into the shadow where they lay silent and trembling </s> It wa a well that his prairie training had given Jefferson Hope the ear of a lynx </s> He and his friend had hardly crouched down before the melancholy hooting of a mountain owl wa heard within a few yard of them which wa immediately answered by another hoot at a small distance </s> At the same moment a vague shadowy figure emerged from the gap for which they had been making and uttered the plaintive signal cry again on which a second man appeared out of the obscurity </s> <s> To morrow at midnight </s> said the first who appeared to be in authority </s> <s> When the Whip poor Will call three time </s> </s> <s> It is well </s> returned the other </s> <s> Shall I tell Brother Drebber </s> </s> <s> Pass it on to him and from him to the others </s> Nine to seven </s> </s> <s> Seven to five </s> </s> repeated the other and the two figure flitted away in different direction </s> Their concluding word had evidently been some form of sign and countersign </s> The instant that their footstep had died away in the distance Jefferson Hope sprang to his foot and helping his companion through the gap led the way across the field at the top of his speed supporting and half carrying the girl when her strength appeared to fail her </s> <s> Hurry on </s> hurry on </s> </s> he gasped from time to time </s> <s> We are through the line of sentinel </s> Everything depends on speed </s> Hurry on </s> </s> Once on the high road they made rapid progress </s> Only once did they meet anyone and then they managed to slip into a field and so avoid recognition </s> Before reaching the town the hunter branched away into a rugged and narrow footpath which led to the mountain </s> Two dark jagged peak loomed above them through the darkness and the defile which led between them wa the Eagle Cañon in which the horse were awaiting them </s> With unerring instinct Jefferson Hope picked his way among the great boulder and along the bed of a dried up watercourse until he came to the retired corner screened with rock where the faithful animal had been picketed </s> The girl wa placed upon the mule and old Ferrier upon one of the horse with his money bag while Jefferson Hope led the other along the precipitous and dangerous path </s> It wa a bewildering route for anyone who wa not accustomed to face Nature in her wildest mood </s> On the one side a great crag towered up a thousand foot or more black stern and menacing with long basaltic column upon it rugged surface like the rib of some petrified monster </s> On the other hand a wild chaos of boulder and debris made all advance impossible </s> Between the two ran the irregular track so narrow in place that they had to travel in Indian file and so rough that only practised rider could have traversed it at all </s> Yet in spite of all danger and difficulty the heart of the fugitive were light within them for every step increased the distance between them and the terrible despotism from which they were flying </s> They soon had a proof however that they were still within the jurisdiction of the Saints </s> They had reached the very wildest and most desolate portion of the pas when the girl gave a startled cry and pointed upwards </s> On a rock which overlooked the track showing out dark and plain against the sky there stood a solitary sentinel </s> He saw them a soon a they perceived him and his military challenge of <s> Who go there </s> </s> rang through the silent ravine </s> <s> Travellers for Nevada </s> said Jefferson Hope with his hand upon the rifle which hung by his saddle </s> They could see the lonely watcher fingering his gun and peering down at them a if dissatisfied at their reply </s> <s> By whose permission </s> </s> he asked </s> <s> The Holy Four </s> answered Ferrier </s> His Mormon experience had taught him that that wa the highest authority to which he could refer </s> <s> Nine from seven </s> cried the sentinel </s> <s> Seven from five </s> returned Jefferson Hope promptly remembering the countersign which he had heard in the garden </s> <s> Pass and the Lord go with you </s> said the voice from above </s> Beyond his post the path broadened out and the horse were able to break into a trot </s> Looking back they could see the solitary watcher leaning upon his gun and knew that they had passed the outlying post of the chosen people and that freedom lay before them </s> CHAPTER V </s> THE AVENGING ANGELS </s> ALL night their course lay through intricate defile and over irregular and rock strewn path </s> More than once they lost their way but Hope’s intimate knowledge of the mountain enabled them to regain the track once more </s> When morning broke a scene of marvellous though savage beauty lay before them </s> In every direction the great snow capped peak hemmed them in peeping over each other’s shoulder to the far horizon </s> So steep were the rocky bank on either side of them that the larch and the pine seemed to be suspended over their head and to need only a gust of wind to come hurtling down upon them </s> Nor wa the fear entirely an illusion for the barren valley wa thickly strewn with tree and boulder which had fallen in a similar manner </s> Even a they passed a great rock came thundering down with a hoarse rattle which woke the echo in the silent gorge and startled the weary horse into a gallop </s> As the sun rose slowly above the eastern horizon the cap of the great mountain lit up one after the other like lamp at a festival until they were all ruddy and glowing </s> The magnificent spectacle cheered the heart of the three fugitive and gave them fresh energy </s> At a wild torrent which swept out of a ravine they called a halt and watered their horse while they partook of a hasty breakfast </s> Lucy and her father would fain have rested longer but Jefferson Hope wa inexorable </s> <s> They will be upon our track by this time </s> he said </s> <s> Everything depends upon our speed </s> Once safe in Carson we may rest for the remainder of our life </s> </s> During the whole of that day they struggled on through the defile and by evening they calculated that they were more than thirty mile from their enemy </s> At night time they chose the base of a beetling crag where the rock offered some protection from the chill wind and there huddled together for warmth they enjoyed a few hours’ sleep </s> Before daybreak however they were up and on their way once more </s> They had seen no sign of any pursuer and Jefferson Hope began to think that they were fairly out of the reach of the terrible organization whose enmity they had incurred </s> He little knew how far that iron grasp could reach or how soon it wa to close upon them and crush them </s> About the middle of the second day of their flight their scanty store of provision began to run out </s> This gave the hunter little uneasiness however for there wa game to be had among the mountain and he had frequently before had to depend upon his rifle for the need of life </s> Choosing a sheltered nook he piled together a few dried branch and made a blazing fire at which his companion might warm themselves for they were now nearly five thousand foot above the sea level and the air wa bitter and keen </s> Having tethered the horse and bade Lucy adieu he threw his gun over his shoulder and set out in search of whatever chance might throw in his way </s> Looking back he saw the old man and the young girl crouching over the blazing fire while the three animal stood motionless in the back ground </s> Then the intervening rock hid them from his view </s> He walked for a couple of mile through one ravine after another without success though from the mark upon the bark of the tree and other indication he judged that there were numerous bear in the vicinity </s> At last after two or three hours’ fruitless search he wa thinking of turning back in despair when casting his eye upwards he saw a sight which sent a thrill of pleasure through his heart </s> On the edge of a jutting pinnacle three or four hundred foot above him there stood a creature somewhat resembling a sheep in appearance but armed with a pair of gigantic horn </s> The big horn</s> <s>for so it is called</s> <s>was acting probably a a guardian over a flock which were invisible to the hunter</s> <s> but fortunately it wa heading in the opposite direction and had not perceived him </s> Lying on his face he rested his rifle upon a rock and took a long and steady aim before drawing the trigger </s> The animal sprang into the air tottered for a moment upon the edge of the precipice and then came crashing down into the valley beneath </s> The creature wa too unwieldy to lift so the hunter contented himself with cutting away one haunch and part of the flank </s> With this trophy over his shoulder he hastened to retrace his step for the evening wa already drawing in </s> He had hardly started however before he realized the difficulty which faced him </s> In his eagerness he had wandered far past the ravine which were known to him and it wa no easy matter to pick out the path which he had taken </s> The valley in which he found himself divided and sub divided into many gorge which were so like each other that it wa impossible to distinguish one from the other </s> He followed one for a mile or more until he came to a mountain torrent which he wa sure that he had never seen before </s> Convinced that he had taken the wrong turn he tried another but with the same result </s> Night wa coming on rapidly and it wa almost dark before he at last found himself in a defile which wa familiar to him </s> Even then it wa no easy matter to keep to the right track for the moon had not yet risen and the high cliff on either side made the obscurity more profound </s> Weighed down with his burden and weary from his exertion he stumbled along keeping up his heart by the reflection that every step brought him nearer to Lucy and that he carried with him enough to ensure them food for the remainder of their journey </s> He had now come to the mouth of the very defile in which he had left them </s> Even in the darkness he could recognize the outline of the cliff which bounded it </s> They must he reflected be awaiting him anxiously for he had been absent nearly five hour </s> In the gladness of his heart he put his hand to his mouth and made the glen re echo to a loud halloo a a signal that he wa coming </s> He paused and listened for an answer </s> None came save his own cry which clattered up the dreary silent ravine and wa borne back to his ear in countless repetition </s> Again he shouted even louder than before and again no whisper came back from the friend whom he had left such a short time ago </s> A vague nameless dread came over him and he hurried onwards frantically dropping the precious food in his agitation </s> When he turned the corner he came full in sight of the spot where the fire had been lit </s> There wa still a glowing pile of wood ash there but it had evidently not been tended since his departure </s> The same dead silence still reigned all round </s> With his fear all changed to conviction he hurried on </s> There wa no living creature near the remains of the fire</s> <s> animal man maiden all were gone </s> It wa only too clear that some sudden and terrible disaster had occurred during his absence</s> <s>a disaster which had embraced them all and yet had left no trace behind it </s> Bewildered and stunned by this blow Jefferson Hope felt his head spin round and had to lean upon his rifle to save himself from falling </s> He wa essentially a man of action however and speedily recovered from his temporary impotence </s> Seizing a half consumed piece of wood from the smouldering fire he blew it into a flame and proceeded with it help to examine the little camp </s> The ground wa all stamped down by the foot of horse showing that a large party of mounted men had overtaken the fugitive and the direction of their track proved that they had afterwards turned back to Salt Lake City </s> Had they carried back both of his companion with them </s> Jefferson Hope had almost persuaded himself that they must have done so when his eye fell upon an object which made every nerve of his body tingle within him </s> A little way on one side of the camp wa a low lying heap of reddish soil which had assuredly not been there before </s> There wa no mistaking it for anything but a newly dug grave </s> As the young hunter approached it he perceived that a stick had been planted on it with a sheet of paper stuck in the cleft fork of it </s> The inscription upon the paper wa brief but to the point</s> <s> JOHN FERRIER FORMERLY OF SALT LAKE CITY <s> 22 </s> Died August 4th 1860 </s> The sturdy old man whom he had left so short a time before wa gone then and this wa all his epitaph </s> Jefferson Hope looked wildly round to see if there wa a second grave but there wa no sign of one </s> Lucy had been carried back by their terrible pursuer to fulfil her original destiny by becoming one of the harem of the Elder’s son </s> As the young fellow realized the certainty of her fate and his own powerlessness to prevent it he wished that he too wa lying with the old farmer in his last silent resting place </s> Again however his active spirit shook off the lethargy which spring from despair </s> If there wa nothing else left to him he could at least devote his life to revenge </s> With indomitable patience and perseverance Jefferson Hope possessed also a power of sustained vindictiveness which he may have learned from the Indians amongst whom he had lived </s> As he stood by the desolate fire he felt that the only one thing which could assuage his grief would be thorough and complete retribution brought by his own hand upon his enemy </s> His strong will and untiring energy should he determined be devoted to that one end </s> With a grim white face he retraced his step to where he had dropped the food and having stirred up the smouldering fire he cooked enough to last him for a few day </s> This he made up into a bundle and tired a he wa he set himself to walk back through the mountain upon the track of the avenging angel </s> For five day he toiled footsore and weary through the defile which he had already traversed on horseback </s> At night he flung himself down among the rock and snatched a few hour of sleep</s> <s> but before daybreak he wa always well on his way </s> On the sixth day he reached the Eagle Cañon from which they had commenced their ill fated flight </s> Thence he could look down upon the home of the saint </s> Worn and exhausted he leaned upon his rifle and shook his gaunt hand fiercely at the silent widespread city beneath him </s> As he looked at it he observed

impression </s> I naturally began by examining the roadway and there a I have already explained to you I saw clearly the mark of a cab which I ascertained by inquiry must have been there during the night </s> I satisfied myself that it wa a cab and not a private carriage by the narrow gauge of the wheel </s> The ordinary London growler is considerably le wide than a gentleman’s brougham </s> <s> This wa the first point gained </s> I then walked slowly down the garden path which happened to be composed of a clay soil peculiarly suitable for taking impression </s> No doubt it appeared to you to be a mere trampled line of slush but to my trained eye every mark upon it surface had a meaning </s> There is no branch of detective science which is so important and so much neglected a the art of tracing footstep </s> Happily I have always laid great stress upon it and much practice ha made it second nature to me </s> I saw the heavy footmark of the constable but I saw also the track of the two men who had first passed through the garden </s> It wa easy to tell that they had been before the others because in place their mark had been entirely obliterated by the others coming upon the top of them </s> In this way my second link wa formed which told me that the nocturnal visitor were two in number one remarkable for his height <s> a I calculated from the length of his stride </s> and the other fashionably dressed to judge from the small and elegant impression left by his boot </s> <s> On entering the house this last inference wa confirmed </s> My well booted man lay before me </s> The tall one then had done the murder if murder there wa </s> There wa no wound upon the dead man’s person but the agitated expression upon his face assured me that he had foreseen his fate before it came upon him </s> Men who die from heart disease or any sudden natural cause never by any chance exhibit agitation upon their feature </s> Having sniffed the dead man’s lip I detected a slightly sour smell and I came to the conclusion that he had had poison forced upon him </s> Again I argued that it had been forced upon him from the hatred and fear expressed upon his face </s> By the method of exclusion I had arrived at this result for no other hypothesis would meet the fact </s> Do not imagine that it wa a very unheard of idea </s> The forcible administration of poison is by no mean a new thing in criminal annals </s> The case of Dolsky in Odessa and of Leturier in Montpellier will occur at once to any toxicologist </s> <s> And now came the great question a to the reason why </s> Robbery had not been the object of the murder for nothing wa taken </s> Was it politics then or wa it a woman </s> That wa the question which confronted me </s> I wa inclined from the first to the latter supposition </s> Political assassin are only too glad to do their work and to fly </s> This murder had on the contrary been done most deliberately and the perpetrator had left his track all over the room showing that he had been there all the time </s> It must have been a private wrong and not a political one which called for such a methodical revenge </s> When the inscription wa discovered upon the wall I wa more inclined than ever to my opinion </s> The thing wa too evidently a blind </s> When the ring wa found however it settled the question </s> Clearly the murderer had used it to remind his victim of some dead or absent woman </s> It wa at this point that I asked Gregson whether he had enquired in his telegram to Cleveland a to any particular point in Mr </s> Drebber’s former career </s> He answered you remember in the negative </s> <s> I then proceeded to make a careful examination of the room which confirmed me in my opinion a to the murderer’s height and furnished me with the additional detail a to the Trichinopoly cigar and the length of his nail </s> I had already come to the conclusion since there were no sign of a struggle that the blood which covered the floor had burst from the murderer’s nose in his excitement </s> I could perceive that the track of blood coincided with the track of his foot </s> It is seldom that any man unless he is very full blooded break out in this way through emotion so I hazarded the opinion that the criminal wa probably a robust and ruddy faced man </s> Events proved that I had judged correctly </s> <s> Having left the house I proceeded to do what Gregson had neglected </s> I telegraphed to the head of the police at Cleveland limiting my enquiry to the circumstance connected with the marriage of Enoch Drebber </s> The answer wa conclusive </s> It told me that Drebber had already applied for the protection of the law against an old rival in love named Jefferson Hope and that this same Hope wa at present in Europe </s> I knew now that I held the clue to the mystery in my hand and all that remained wa to secure the murderer </s> <s> I had already determined in my own mind that the man who had walked into the house with Drebber wa none other than the man who had driven the cab </s> The mark in the road showed me that the horse had wandered on in a way which would have been impossible had there been anyone in charge of it </s> Where then could the driver be unless he were inside the house </s> Again it is absurd to suppose that any sane man would carry out a deliberate crime under the very eye a it were of a third person who wa sure to betray him </s> Lastly supposing one man wished to dog another through London what better mean could he adopt than to turn cabdriver </s> All these consideration led me to the irresistible conclusion that Jefferson Hope wa to be found among the jarveys of the Metropolis </s> <s> If he had been one there wa no reason to believe that he had ceased to be </s> On the contrary from his point of view any sudden change would be likely to draw attention to himself </s> He would probably for a time at least continue to perform his duty </s> There wa no reason to suppose that he wa going under an assumed name </s> Why should he change his name in a country where no one knew his original one </s> I therefore organized my Street Arab detective corp and sent them systematically to every cab proprietor in London until they ferreted out the man that I wanted </s> How well they succeeded and how quickly I took advantage of it are still fresh in your recollection </s> The murder of Stangerson wa an incident which wa entirely unexpected but which could hardly in any case have been prevented </s> Through it a you know I came into

only thing which they met </s> They swung along with the huge tomb looming up through the darkness upon each side of them until they had come a far a the Catacombs of St </s> Calistus and saw against a rising moon the great circular bastion of Cecilia Metella in front of them </s> Then Burger stopped with his hand to his side </s> "Your leg are longer than mine and you are more accustomed to walking " said he laughing </s> "I think that the place where we turn off is somewhere here </s> Yes this is it round the corner of the trattoria </s> Now it is a very narrow path so perhaps I had better go in front and you can follow </s> " He had lit his lantern and by it light they were enabled to follow a narrow and devious track which wound across the marsh of the Campagna </s> The great Aqueduct of old Rome lay like a monstrous caterpillar across the moonlit landscape and their road led them under one of it huge arch and past the circle of crumbling brick which mark the old arena </s> At last Burger stopped at a solitary wooden cow house and he drew a key from his pocket </s> "Surely your catacomb is not inside a house </s> " cried Kennedy </s> "The entrance to it is </s> That is just the safeguard which we have against anyone else discovering it </s> " "Does the proprietor know of it </s> " "Not he </s> He had found one or two object which made me almost certain that his

manger of the cow along one wall </s> Burger put his lantern down on the ground and shaded it light in all direction save one by draping his overcoat round it </s> "It might excite remark if anyone

their mine ha been called Blue John Gap a clean cut arch in the rock the mouth all overgrown with bush </s> It is a goodly passage which the Roman miner have cut and it intersects some of the great water worn cave so that if you enter Blue John Gap you would do well to mark your step and to have a good store of candle or you may never make your way back to the daylight again </s> I have not yet

sheep disappeared were invariably very dark cloudy night with no moon </s> This I met with the obvious retort that those were the night which a commonplace sheep stealer would naturally choose for his work </s> On one occasion a gap had been made in a wall and some of the stone scattered for a considerable distance </s> Human agency again in my opinion </s> Finally Armitage clinched all his argument by telling me that he had actually heard the Creature</s> <s>indeed that anyone could hear it who remained long enough at the Gap </s> It wa a distant roaring of an immense volume </s> I could not but smile at this knowing a I do the strange reverberation which come out of an underground water system running amid the chasm of a limestone formation </s> My incredulity annoyed Armitage so that he turned and left me with some abruptness </s> And now come the queer point about the whole business </s> I wa still standing near the mouth of the cave turning over in my mind the various statement of Armitage and reflecting how readily they could be explained away when suddenly from the depth of the tunnel beside me there issued a most extraordinary sound </s> How shall I describe it </s> First of all it seemed to be a great distance away far down in the bowel of the earth </s> Secondly in spite of this suggestion of distance it wa very loud </s> Lastly it wa not a boom nor a crash such a one would associate with falling water or tumbling rock but it wa a high whine tremulous and vibrating almost like the whinnying of a horse </s> It wa certainly a most remarkable experience and one which for a moment I must admit gave a new significance to Armitage s word </s> I waited by the Blue John Gap for half an hour or more but there wa no return of the sound so at last I wandered back to the farmhouse rather mystified by what had occurred </s> Decidedly I shall explore that cavern when my strength is restored </s> Of course Armitage s explanation is too absurd for

the entrance of the cave do present an appearance a if some heavy creature had forced it way through them </s> I begin to be keenly interested </s> I have said nothing to the Miss Allertons for they are quite superstitious enough already but I have bought some candle and mean to investigate for myself </s> I observed this morning that among the numerous tuft of sheep s wool which lay among the bush near the cavern there wa one which wa smeared with blood </s> Of course my reason tell me that if sheep wander into such rocky place they are likely to injure themselves and yet somehow that

angle for some fifty foot the floor being covered with broken stone </s> Thence there extended a long straight passage cut in the solid rock </s> I am no geologist but the lining of this corridor wa certainly of some harder material than limestone for there were point where I could actually see the tool mark which the old miner had left in their excavation a fresh a if they had been done

came to a spot where the Roman tunnel opened into a water worn cavern</s> <s>a huge hall hung with long white icicle of lime deposit </s> From this central chamber I could dimly perceive that a number of passage worn by the subterranean stream wound away into the depth of the earth </s> I wa standing there wondering whether I had better return or whether I dare venture farther into this dangerous labyrinth when my eye fell upon something at my foot which strongly arrested my attention </s> The greater part of the floor of the cavern wa covered with boulder of rock or with hard incrustation of lime but at this particular point there had been a drip from the distant roof which had left a patch of soft mud </s> In the very centre of this there wa a huge mark</s> <s>an ill defined blotch deep

possible animal and besides there wa only the one and the patch of mud wa of such a size that no reasonable stride could have covered it </s> As I rose from the examination of that singular mark and then looked round into the black shadow which hemmed me in I must confess that I felt for a moment a most unpleasant sinking of my heart and that do what I could the candle trembled in my outstretched hand </s> I soon recovered my nerve however when I reflected how absurd it wa to associate so huge and shapeless a mark with the track of any known animal </s> Even an elephant could not have produced it </s> I determined therefore that I would not be scared by vague and senseless fear from carrying out my exploration </s> Before proceeding I took good note of a curious rock formation in the wall by which I could recognize the entrance of the Roman tunnel </s> The precaution wa very necessary for the great cave so far a I could see it wa intersected by passage </s> Having made sure of my position and reassured myself by examining my spare candle and my match I advanced slowly over the rocky and uneven surface of the cavern </s> And now I come to the point where I met with such sudden and desperate disaster </s> A stream some twenty foot broad ran across my path and I walked for some little distance along the bank to find a spot where I could cross dry shod </s> Finally I came to a place where a single flat boulder lay near the centre which I could reach in a stride </s> As it chanced however the rock had been cut away and made top heavy by the rush of the stream so that it tilted over a I landed on it and shot me into the ice cold water </s> My candle went out and I found myself floundering about in utter and absolute darkness </s> I staggered to my foot again more amused than alarmed by my adventure </s> The candle had fallen from my hand and wa lost in the stream but I had two others in my pocket so that it wa of no importance </s> I got one of them ready and

<s> "It wa useless for our correspondent or for any of the adventurous gentleman who had come from Matlock Buxton and other part to offer to descend to explore the cave to the end and to finally test

night to ourselves </s> Let me have an idea of how your affair stand and I will see what can be done to set them in order </s> I wish to hear every detail </s> " Thus encouraged I entered into a long exposition in which all my tradesman and creditor from my landlord to my valet figured in turn </s> I had note in my pocket book and I marshalled my fact and gave I flatter myself a very businesslike

out a remark it wa so entirely perfunctory and pointless that I wa sure he had not in the least followed my remark </s> Every now and then he roused himself and put on some show of interest asking me to repeat or to explain more fully but it wa always to sink once more into the same brown study </s> At last he rose and threw the end of his cigar into the grate </s> "I ll tell you what my boy " said he </s> "I never had a head for figure so you will excuse me </s> You must jot it all down upon paper and let me have a note of the amount </s> I ll understand it when I see it in black and white </s> " The proposal wa encouraging </s> I promised to do so </s> "And now it s time we were in bed </s> By Jove there s one o clock striking in the hall </s> " The tingling of the chiming clock broke through the deep roar of the gale </s> The wind wa sweeping past with the rush of a great river </s> "I must see my cat before I go to bed " said my host </s> "A high wind excites him </s> Will you come </s> " "Certainly " said I </s> "Then tread softly and don t speak for everyone is asleep </s> " We passed quietly down the lamp lit Persian rugged hall and through the door at the farther end </s> All wa dark in the stone corridor but a stable lantern hung on a hook and my host took it down and lit it </s> There wa no grating visible in the passage so I knew that the beast wa in it cage </s> "Come in </s> " said my relative and opened the door </s> A deep growling a we entered showed that the storm had really excited the creature </s> In the flickering light of the lantern we saw it

He passed out and the door shut with a sharp metallic click behind him </s> That hard crisp sound made my heart stand still </s> A sudden wave of terror passed over me </s> A vague perception of some

my host from the passage </s> "You ve got the light all right </s> " "Yes but I don t care about being locked in alone like this </s> " "Don t you </s> " I heard his hearty chuckling laugh </s> "You won t be alone long </s> " "Let me out sir </s> " I repeated angrily </s> "I tell you I don t allow practical joke of this sort </s> " "Practical is the word " said he with another hateful chuckle </s> And then suddenly I heard amidst the roar of the storm the creak and whine of the winch handle turning and the rattle of the grating a it passed through the slot </s> Great God he wa letting loose the Brazilian cat </s> In the light of the lantern I saw the bar sliding slowly before me </s> Already there wa an opening a foot wide at the farther end </s> With a scream I seized the last bar with my hand and pulled with the strength of a madman </s> I WAS a madman with rage and horror </s> For a minute or more I held the thing motionless </s> I knew that he wa straining with all his force upon the handle and that the leverage wa sure to overcome me </s> I gave inch by inch my foot sliding along the stone and all the time I begged and prayed this inhuman monster to save me from this horrible death </s> I conjured him by his kinship </s> I reminded him that I wa his guest</s> <s> I begged to know what harm I had ever done him </s> His only answer were the tug and jerk upon the handle each of which in spite of all my struggle pulled another bar through the opening </s> Clinging and clutching I wa dragged across the whole front of the cage until at last with aching wrist and lacerated finger I gave up the hopeless struggle </s> The grating clanged back a I released it and an instant later I heard the shuffle of the Turkish slipper in the passage and the slam of the distant door </s> Then everything wa silent </s> The creature had never moved during this time </s> He lay still in the corner and his tail had ceased switching </s> This apparition of a man adhering to his bar and dragged screaming across him had apparently filled him with amazement </s> I saw his great eye staring steadily at me </s> I had dropped the lantern when I seized the bar but it still burned upon the floor and I made a movement to grasp it with some idea that it light might protect me </s> But the instant I moved the beast gave a deep and menacing growl </s> I stopped and stood still quivering with fear in every limb </s> The cat <s> if one may call so fearful a creature by so homely a name </s> wa not more than ten foot from me </s> The eye glimmered like two disk of phosphorus in the darkness </s> They appalled and yet fascinated me </s> I could not take my own eye from them </s> Nature play strange trick with u at such moment of intensity and those glimmering

there may be any truth in the old idea of the dominance of the human gaze or whether the huge cat wa simply drowsy but the fact remains that far from showing any symptom of attacking me it simply rested it sleek black head upon it huge forepaw and seemed to sleep </s> I stood fearing to move lest I should rouse it into malignant life once more </s> But at least I wa able to think clearly now that the baleful eye were off me </s> Here I wa shut up for the night with the ferocious beast </s> My own instinct to say nothing of the word of the plausible villain who laid this trap for me warned

seemed to promise I will not say safety but le immediate and imminent danger than the open floor </s> I have said that the cage had a top a well a a front and this top wa left standing when the front wa wound through the slot in the wall </s> It consisted of bar at a few inch interval with stout wire netting between and it rested upon a strong stanchion at each end </s> It stood now a a great barred canopy over the crouching figure in the corner </s> The space between this iron shelf and the roof may have been from two or three foot </s> If I could only get up there squeezed in between bar and ceiling I should have only one vulnerable side </s> I should be safe from below from behind and from each side </s> Only on the open face of it could I be attacked </s> There it is true I had no protection whatever</s> <s> but at least I should be out of the brute s path when he began to pace about his den </s> He would have to come out of his way to reach me </s> It wa now or never for if once the light were out it would be impossible </s> With a gulp in my throat I sprang up seized the iron edge of the top and swung myself panting on to it </s> I writhed in face downwards and found myself looking straight into the terrible eye and yawning jaw of the cat </s> Its fetid breath came up into my face like the steam from some foul pot </s> It appeared however to be rather curious than angry </s> With a sleek ripple of it long black back it rose stretched itself and then rearing itself on it hind leg with one forepaw against the wall it raised the other and drew it claw across the wire mesh beneath me </s> One sharp white hook tore through my trousers</s> <s>for I may mention that I wa still in evening dress</s> <s>and dug a furrow in my knee </s> It wa not meant a an attack

direction </s> For my part I shuffled backwards until I lay with my back against the wall screwing myself into the smallest space possible </s> The farther I got the more difficult it wa for him to attack me </s> He seemed more excited now that he had begun to move about and he ran swiftly and noiselessly round and round the den passing continually underneath the iron couch upon which I lay </s> It wa wonderful to see so great a bulk passing like a shadow with hardly the softest thudding of velvety pad </s> The candle wa burning low</s> <s>so low that I could hardly see the creature </s> And

There is nothing for it then but to quietly await the result </s> In this case there wa no chance of safety anywhere except the precise spot where I wa </s> I stretched myself out therefore and lay

very unwilling to go into general practice for my taste were all in the direction of science and especially of zoology towards which I had always a strong leaning </s> I had almost given the fight up

me about beetle </s> " I looked across to see if he wa joking but on the contrary he wa leaning eagerly forward across his desk and there wa an expression of something like anxiety in his eye </s> "I am afraid that you do not know about beetle " he cried </s> "On the contrary sir it is the one scientific subject about which I feel that I really do know something </s> " "I am overjoyed to hear it </s> Please talk to me about beetle </s> " I talked </s> I do not profess to have said anything original upon the subject but I gave a short sketch of the characteristic of the beetle and ran over the more common specie with some allusion to the specimen in my own little collection and to the article upon "Burying Beetles" which I had contributed to the Journal of Entomological Science </s> "What </s> not a collector </s> " cried Lord Linchmere </s> "You don t mean that you are yourself a collector </s> " His eye danced with pleasure at the thought </s> "You are certainly the very man in

you </s> " He rang a gong upon the table and the footman entered </s> "Ask Lady Rossiter to have the goodness to step this way " said his lordship and a few moment later the lady wa ushered into the room </s> She wa a small middle aged woman very like Lord Linchmere in appearance with the same quick alert feature and grey black hair </s> The expression of anxiety however which I had observed upon his face wa very much more marked upon hers </s> Some great grief seemed to have cast it shadow over her feature </s> As Lord Linchmere presented me she turned her face full upon me and I wa shocked

Lady Rossiter </s> "Then you must have heard of my husband </s> Everyone who know anything about beetle must have heard of Sir Thomas Rossiter </s> " For the first time a thin little ray of light began to break into the obscure business </s> Here at last wa a connection between these people and beetle </s> Sir Thomas Rossiter</s> <s>he wa the greatest authority upon the subject in the world

</s> "No I have not </s> " "But you shall " said Lord Linchmere with decision </s> The lady wa standing beside the desk and she put her hand upon his shoulder </s> It wa obvious to me a I saw their face together that they were brother and sister </s> "Are you really prepared for this Charles </s> It is noble of you but you fill me with fear </s> " Her voice quavered with apprehension and he

to come for a short journey with me to remain always at my side and to promise to do without question whatever I may ask you however unreasonable it may appear to you to be </s> " "That is a good deal to ask " said I </s> "Unfortunately I cannot put it more plainly for I do not myself know what turn matter may take </s> You may be sure however that you will not be asked to do anything which your

may I rely upon your aid </s> " "Most undoubtedly " said I </s> "You have only to tell me what my duty are </s> " "Your first duty will be to return to your home </s> You will pack up whatever you may

your case for collecting beetle and the other is a stick and the thicker and heavier the better </s> " You may imagine that I had plenty to think of from the time that I left Brook Street until I set out to meet Lord Linchmere at Paddington </s> The whole fantastic business kept arranging and rearranging itself in kaleidoscopic form inside my brain until I had thought out a dozen explanation each of them more grotesquely improbable than the last </s> And yet I felt that the truth must be something grotesquely improbable also </s> At last I gave up all attempt at finding a solution and contented myself with exactly carrying out the instruction which I had received </s> With a hand valise specimen case and a loaded cane I wa waiting at the Paddington bookstall when Lord Linchmere arrived </s> He wa an even smaller man than I had thought</s> <s>frail and peaky with a manner which wa more nervous than it had been in the morning </s> He wore a long thick travelling ulster and I observed that he carried a heavy blackthorn cudgel in his hand </s> "I have the ticket " said he leading the way up the platform </s> "This is our train </s> I have engaged a carriage for I am particularly anxious to impress one or two thing upon you while we travel down </s> " And yet all that he had to impress upon me might have been said in a sentence for it wa that I wa to remember that I wa there a a protection to himself and that I wa not on any consideration to leave him for an instant </s> This he repeated again and again a our journey drew to a close with an insistence which showed that his nerve were thoroughly shaken </s> "Yes " he said at last in answer to my look rather than to my word "I AM nervous Dr </s> Hamilton </s> I have always been a timid man and my timidity depends upon my frail physical health </s> But my soul is firm and I can bring myself up to face a danger which a le nervous man might shrink from </s> What I am doing now is done from no compulsion but entirely from a sense of duty and yet it is beyond doubt a desperate risk </s> If thing should go wrong I will have some claim to the title of martyr </s> " This eternal reading of riddle wa too much for me </s> I felt that I must put a term to it </s> "I think it would very much better sir if you were to trust me entirely " said I </s> "It is impossible for me to act effectively when I do not know what are the object which we have in view or even where we are going </s> " "Oh a to where we are going there need be no mystery about that " said he</s> <s> "we are going to Delamere Court

matter Dr </s> Hamilton if I were asking your advice </s> As matter stand it is only your active help which I need and I will indicate to you from time to time how you can best give it </s> " There wa nothing more to be said and a poor man can put up with a good deal for twenty pound a day but I felt none the le that Lord Linchmere wa acting rather scurvily towards me </s> He wished to convert me into a passive tool like the blackthorn in his hand </s> With his sensitive disposition I could imagine however that scandal would be abhorrent to him and I realized that he would not take me into his confidence until no other course wa open to him </s> I must trust to my own eye and ear to solve the mystery but I had every confidence that I should not trust to them in vain </s> Delamere Court lie a good five mile from Pangbourne Station and we drove for that distance in an open fly </s> Lord Linchmere sat in deep thought during the time and he never opened his mouth until we were close to our destination </s> When he did speak it wa to give me a piece of information which surprised me </s> "Perhaps you are not aware " said he "that I am a medical man like yourself </s> " "No sir I did not know it </s> " "Yes I qualified in my younger day when there were several life between me and the peerage </s> I have not had occasion to practise but I have found it a useful education all the same

side of the fly </s> "Let me present you to Sir Thomas Rossiter Dr </s> Hamilton " said Lord Linchmere </s> "You will find that you have a strong community of taste </s> " I bowed </s> Sir Thomas stood very stiffly looking at me severely from under the broad brim of his hat </s> "Lord Linchmere tell me that you know something about beetle " said he </s> "What do you know about beetle </s> " "I know what I have learned from your work upon the coleoptera Sir Thomas " I answered </s> "Give me the name of the better known specie of the British scarabaeus " said he </s> I had not expected an examination but fortunately I wa ready for one </s> My answer seemed to please him for his stern feature relaxed </s> "You appear to have read my book with some profit sir " said he </s> "It is a rare thing for me to meet anyone who take an intelligent interest in such matter </s> People can find time for such triviality a sport or society and yet the beetle are overlooked </s> I can assure you

glad to see you sir and I have no doubt that I can show you some specimen which will interest you </s> " He stepped into the fly and drove up with u to the house expounding to me a we went some recent

strikingly visible a he turned towards u after entering the study and seemed the more singular from the contrast with the hard steady grey eye which looked out from underneath those palpitating brow </s> "I am sorry " said he "that Lady Rossiter is not here to help me to welcome you </s> By the way Charles did Evelyn say anything about the date of her return </s> " "She wished to stay in town for

"I lead a retired life Dr </s> Hamilton and my aversion to stranger grows upon me " said our host </s> "I have sometimes thought that my nerve are not so good a they were </s> My travel in search of

rare specimen and handling it with a much delicacy and reverence a if it were a precious relic he would hold forth upon it peculiarity and the circumstance under which it came into his possession </s> It wa evidently an unusual thing for him to meet with a sympathetic listener and he talked and talked until the spring evening had deepened into night and the gong announced that it wa time to dress for dinner </s> All the time Lord Linchmere said nothing but he stood at his brother in law s elbow and I caught him continually shooting curious little questioning glance into his face </s> And his own feature expressed some strong emotion apprehension sympathy expectation</s> <s> I seemed to read them all </s> I wa sure that Lord Linchmere wa fearing something and awaiting something but what that something might be I could not imagine </s> The evening passed quietly but pleasantly and I should have been entirely at my ease if it had not been for that continual sense of tension upon the

to school </s> The house he said wa not the same without them </s> If it were not for his scientific study he did not know how he could get through the day </s> After dinner we smoked for some time in the billiard room and finally went early to bed </s> And then it wa that for the first time the suspicion that Lord Linchmere wa a lunatic crossed my mind </s> He followed me into my bedroom when our

But this is part of your duty </s> My room is close by and you can return to your own before the servant call you in the morning </s> " "But why </s> " I asked </s> "Because I am nervous of being alone " said he </s> "That s the reason since you must have a reason </s> " It seemed rank lunacy but the argument of those twenty pound would overcome many objection </s> I followed him to his room </s> "Well " said I "there s only room for one in that bed </s> " "Only one shall occupy it " said he </s> "And the other </s> " "Must remain on watch </s> " "Why </s> " said I </s> "One would think you expected to be attacked </s> " "Perhaps I do </s> " "In that case why not lock your door </s> " "Perhaps I WANT to be attacked </s> " It looked more and more like lunacy </s> However there wa nothing for it but to submit </s> I shrugged my shoulder and sat down in the arm chair beside the empty fireplace </s> "I am to remain on watch then </s> " said I ruefully </s> "We will divide the night </s> If you will watch until two I will watch the remainder </s> " "Very good </s> " "Call me at two o clock then </s> " "I will do so </s> " "Keep your ear open and if you hear any sound wake me instantly</s> <s>instantly you hear </s> " "You can rely upon it </s> " I tried to look a solemn a he did </s> "And for God s sake don t go to sleep " said he and so taking off only his coat he threw the coverlet over him and settled down for the night </s> It wa a melancholy vigil and made more so by my own sense of it folly </s> Supposing that by any chance Lord Linchmere had cause to suspect that he wa subject to danger in the house of Sir Thomas Rossiter why on earth could he not lock his door and so protect himself </s> His own answer that he might wish to be attacked wa absurd </s> Why should he possibly wish to be attacked </s> And who would wish to attack him </s> Clearly Lord Linchmere wa suffering from some singular delusion and the result wa that on an imbecile pretext I wa to be deprived of my night s rest </s> Still however absurd I wa determined to carry out his injunction to the letter a long a I wa in his employment </s> I sat therefore beside the empty fireplace and listened to a sonorous chiming clock somewhere down the passage which gurgled and struck every quarter of an hour </s> It wa an endless vigil </s> Save for that single clock an absolute silence reigned throughout the great house </s> A small lamp stood on the table at my elbow throwing a circle of light round my chair but leaving the corner of the room draped in shadow </s> On the bed Lord Linchmere wa breathing peacefully </s> I envied him his quiet sleep and again and again my own eyelid drooped but every time my sense of duty came to my help and I sat up rubbing my eye and pinching myself with a determination to see my irrational watch to an end </s> And I did so </s> From down the passage came the chime of two o clock and I laid my hand upon the shoulder of the sleeper </s> Instantly he wa sitting up with an expression of the keenest interest upon his face </s> "You have heard something </s> " "No sir </s> It is two o clock </s> " "Very good </s> I will watch </s> You can go to sleep </s> " I lay down under the coverlet a he had done and wa soon unconscious </s> My last recollection wa of that circle of lamplight and of the small hunched up figure and strained

told me that the lamp had only that instant been extinguished </s> "Quick </s> Quick </s> " said Lord Linchmere s voice in my ear </s> I sprang out of bed he still dragging at my arm </s> "Over here </s> " he whispered and pulled me into a corner of the room </s> "Hush </s> Listen </s> " In the silence of the night I could distinctly hear that someone wa coming down the corridor </s> It wa a stealthy step faint and intermittent a of a man who paused cautiously after every stride </s> Sometimes for half a minute there wa no sound and then came the shuffle and creak which told of a fresh advance </s> My companion wa trembling with excitement </s> His hand which still held my sleeve twitched like a branch in the wind </s> "What is it </s> " I whispered </s> "It s he </s> " "Sir Thomas </s> " "Yes </s> " "What doe he want </s> " "Hush </s> Do nothing until I tell you </s> " I wa conscious now that someone wa trying the door </s> There wa the faintest little rattle from the handle and then I dimly saw a thin slit of subdued light </s> There wa a lamp burning somewhere far down the passage and it just sufficed to make the outside visible from the darkness of our room </s> The greyish slit grew broader and broader very gradually very gently and then outlined against it I saw the dark figure of a man </s> He wa squat and crouching with the silhouette of a bulky and misshapen dwarf </s> Slowly the door swung open with this ominous shape framed in the centre of it </s> And then in an instant the crouching figure shot up there wa a tiger spring across the room and thud thud thud came three tremendous blow from some heavy object upon the bed </s> I wa so paralysed with amazement that I stood motionless and staring until I wa aroused by a yell for help from my companion </s> The open door shed enough light for me to see the outline of thing and there wa little Lord Linchmere with his arm round the neck of his brother in law holding bravely on to him like a game bull terrier with it teeth into a gaunt deerhound </s> The tall bony man dashed himself about writhing round and round to get a grip upon his assailant</s> <s> but the other clutching on from behind still

teeth meet in my shoulder </s> With all my youth and weight and strength it wa a desperate struggle before we could master his frenzied struggles</s> <s> but at last we secured his arm with the waist cord of the dressing gown which he wa wearing </s> I wa holding his leg while Lord Linchmere wa endeavouring to relight the lamp when there came the pattering of many foot in the passage and the butler and two footman who had been alarmed by the cry rushed into the room </s> With their aid we had no further difficulty in securing our prisoner who lay foaming and glaring upon the ground </s> One glance at his face wa enough to prove that he wa a dangerous maniac while the short heavy hammer which lay beside the bed showed how murderous had been his intention </s> "Do not use any violence </s> " said Lord Linchmere a we raised the struggling man to his foot </s> "He will have a period of stupor after this excitement </s> I believe that it is coming on already </s> " As he spoke the convulsion became le violent and the madman s head fell forward upon his breast a if he were overcome by sleep </s> We led him down the passage and stretched him upon his own bed where he lay unconscious breathing heavily </s> "Two of you will watch him " said Lord Linchmere </s> "And now Dr </s> Hamilton if you will return with me to my room I will give you the explanation which my horror of scandal ha perhaps caused me to delay too long </s> Come what may you will never have cause to regret your share in this night s work </s> "The case may be made clear in a very few word " he continued when we were alone </s> "My poor brother in law is one of the best fellow upon earth a loving husband and an estimable father but he come from a stock which is deeply tainted with insanity </s> He ha more than once had homicidal outbreak which are the more painful because his inclination is always to attack the very person to whom he is most attached </s> His son wa sent away to school to avoid this danger and then came an attempt upon my sister his wife from which she escaped with injury that you may have observed when you met her in London </s> You understand that he know nothing of the matter when he is in his sound sens and would ridicule the suggestion that he could under any circumstance injure those whom he love so dearly </s> It is often a you know a characteristic of such malady that it is absolutely impossible to convince the man who suffers from them of their existence </s> "Our great object wa of course to get him under restraint before he could stain his hand with blood but the matter wa full of difficulty </s> He is a recluse in his habit and would not see any medical man </s> Besides it wa necessary for our purpose that the medical man should convince himself of his insanity</s> <s> and he is sane a you or I save on these very rare occasion </s> But fortunately before he ha these attack he always show certain premonitory symptom which are providential danger signal warning u to be upon our guard </s> The chief of these is that nervous contortion of the forehead which you must have observed </s> This is a phenomenon which always appears from three to four day before his attack of frenzy </s> The moment it showed itself his wife came into town on some pretext and took refuge in my house in Brook Street </s> "It remained for me to convince a medical man of Sir Thomas s insanity without which it wa impossible to put him where he could do no harm </s> The first problem wa how to get a medical man into his house </s> I bethought me of his interest in beetle and his love for anyone who shared his taste </s> I advertised therefore and wa fortunate enough to find in you the very man I wanted </s> A stout companion wa necessary for I knew that the lunacy could only be proved by a murderous assault and I had every reason to believe that that assault would be made upon myself since he had the warmest regard for me in his moment of sanity </s> I think your intelligence will supply all the rest </s> I did not know that the attack would come by night but I thought it very probable for the crisis of such case usually do occur in the early hour of the morning </s> I am a very nervous man myself but I saw no other way in which I could remove this terrible danger from my sister s life </s> I need not ask you whether you are willing to sign the lunacy paper </s> " "Undoubtedly </s> But TWO signature are necessary </s> " "You forget that I am myself a holder of a medical degree </s> I have the paper on a side table here so if you will be good enough to sign them now we can have the patient removed in the morning </s> " So that wa my visit to Sir Thomas Rossiter the famous beetle hunter and that wa also my first step upon the ladder of success for Lady Rossiter and Lord Linchmere have proved to be staunch friend and they have never forgotten my association with them in the time of their need </s> Sir Thomas is out and said to be cured but I still think that if I spent another night at Delamere Court I should be inclined to lock my door upon the inside </s> The Man with the Watches There are many who will still bear in mind the singular circumstance which under the heading of the Rugby Mystery filled many column of the daily Press in the spring of the year 1892 </s> Coming a it did at a period of exceptional dullness it attracted perhaps rather more attention than it deserved but it offered to the public that mixture of the whimsical and the tragic which is most stimulating to the popular imagination </s> Interest drooped however when after week of fruitless investigation it wa found that no final explanation of the fact wa forthcoming and the tragedy seemed from that time to the present to have finally taken it place in the dark catalogue of inexplicable and unexpiated crime </s> A recent communication <s> the authenticity of which appears to be above question </s> ha however thrown some new and clear light upon the matter </s> Before laying it before the public it would be a well perhaps that I should refresh their memory a to the singular fact upon which this commentary is founded </s> These fact were briefly a follows</s> <s> At five o clock on the evening of the 18th of March in the year already mentioned a train left Euston Station for Manchester </s> It wa a

the crime the question of how or why three passenger <s> one of them a lady </s> could get out of the train and one other get in during the unbroken run between Willesden and Rugby wa one which

change to a clearer atmosphere </s> Supposing that the man with the black beard had done so at Willesden <s> and the half smoked cigar upon the floor seemed to favour the supposition </s> he would naturally go into the nearest section which would bring him into the company of the two other actor in this drama </s> Thus the first stage of the affair might be surmised without any great breach of

Advertisement reward and inquiry proved equally fruitless and nothing could be found which wa solid enough to form the basis for a profitable investigation </s> It would be a mistake however to suppose that no theory were formed to account for the fact </s> On the contrary the Press both in England and in America teemed with suggestion and supposition most of which were obviously absurd </s> The fact that the watch were of American make and some peculiarity in connection with the gold stopping of his front tooth appeared to indicate that the deceased wa a citizen of the United States though his linen clothes and boot were undoubtedly of British manufacture </s> It wa surmised by some that he wa concealed under the seat and that being discovered he wa for some reason possibly because he had overheard their guilty secret put to death by his fellow passenger </s> When coupled with generality a to the ferocity and cunning of anarchical and other secret society this theory sounded a plausible a any </s> The fact that he should be without a ticket would be consistent with the idea of concealment and it wa well known that woman played a prominent part in the Nihilistic propaganda </s> On the other hand it wa clear from the guard s statement that the man must have been hidden there BEFORE the others arrived and how unlikely the coincidence that conspirator should stray exactly into the very compartment in which a spy wa already concealed </s> Besides this explanation ignored the man in the smoking carriage and gave no reason at all for his simultaneous disappearance </s> The police had little difficulty in showing that such a theory would not cover the fact but they were unprepared in the absence of evidence to advance any alternative explanation

can then test this explanation by any fresh fact which may arise </s> If they all fit into their place the probability is that we are upon the right track and with each fresh fact this probability increase in a geometrical progression until the evidence becomes final and convincing </s> "Now there is one most remarkable and suggestive fact which ha not met with the attention which it deserves </s> There is a local train running through Harrow and King s Langley which is timed in such a way that the express must have overtaken it at or about the period when it eased down it speed to eight mile an hour on account of the repair of the line </s> The two train would at that time be travelling in the same direction at a similar rate of speed and upon parallel line </s> It is within every one s experience how under such circumstance the occupant of each carriage can see very plainly the passenger in the other carriage opposite to him </s> The lamp of the express had been lit at Willesden so that each compartment wa brightly illuminated and most visible to an observer from outside </s> "Now the sequence of event a I reconstruct them would be after this fashion </s> This young man with the abnormal number of watch wa alone in the carriage of the slow train </s> His ticket with his paper and glove and other thing wa we will suppose on the seat beside him </s> He wa probably an American and also probably a man of weak intellect </s> The excessive wearing of jewellery is an early symptom in some form of mania </s> "As he sat watching the carriage of the express which were <s> on account of the state of the line </s> going at the same pace a himself he suddenly saw some people in it whom he knew </s> We will suppose for the sake of our theory that these people were a woman whom he loved and a man whom he hated</s> <s>and who in return hated him </s> The young man wa excitable and impulsive </s> He opened the door of his carriage stepped from the footboard of the local train to the footboard of the express opened the other door and made his way into the presence of these two people </s> The feat <s> on the supposition that the train were going at the same pace </s> is by no mean so perilous a it might appear </s> "Having now got our young man without his ticket into the carriage in which the elder man and the young woman are travelling it is not difficult to imagine that a violent scene ensued </s> It is possible that the pair were also Americans which is the more probable a the man carried a weapon</s> <s>an unusual thing in England </s> If our supposition of incipient mania is correct the young man is likely to have assaulted the other </s> As the upshot of the quarrel the elder man shot the intruder and then made his escape from the carriage taking the young lady with him </s> We will suppose that all this happened very rapidly and that the train wa still going at so slow a pace that it wa not difficult for them to leave it </s> A woman might leave a train going at eight mile an hour </s> As a matter of fact we know that this woman DID do so </s> "And now we have to fit in the man in the smoking carriage </s> Presuming that we have up to this point reconstructed the tragedy correctly we shall find nothing in this other man to cause u to reconsider our conclusion </s> According to my theory this man saw the young fellow cross from one train to the other saw him open the door heard the pistol shot saw the two fugitive spring out on to the line realized that murder had been done and sprang out himself in pursuit </s> Why he ha never been heard of since</s> <s>whether he met his own death in the pursuit or whether a is more likely he wa made to realize that it wa not a case for his interference</s> <s>is a detail

Langley upon the 18th of March </s> If such a ticket were found my case is proved </s> If not my theory may still be the correct one for it is conceivable either that he travelled without a ticket or that his ticket wa lost </s> " To this elaborate and plausible hypothesis the answer of the police and of the company wa first that no such ticket wa found</s> <s> secondly that the slow train would never run parallel to the express</s> <s> and thirdly that the local train had been stationary in King s Langley Station when the express going at fifty mile an hour had flashed past it </s> So

a direct question from her counsel she replied that she did not feel that she had any grievance whatever against Dr </s> Lana and that in her opinion he had acted in a perfectly honourable manner </s> Her brother on an insufficient knowledge of the fact had taken another view and she wa compelled to acknowledge that in spite of her entreaty he had uttered threat of personal violence against the
