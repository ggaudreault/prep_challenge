the hound OF the baskervil By A. conan doyl chapter 1 . mr. sherlock holm mr. sherlock holm , who wa usual veri late in the morn , save upon those not infrequ occas when he wa up all night , wa seat at the breakfast tabl . I stood upon the hearth-rug and pick up the stick which our visitor had left behind him the night befor . It wa a fine , thick piec of wood , bulbous-head , of the sort which is known as a “ penang lawyer. ” just under the head wa a broad silver band nearli an inch across . “ To jame mortim , m.r.c.s. , from hi friend of the c.c.h. , ” wa engrav upon it , with the date “ 1884. ” It wa just such a stick as the old-fashion famili practition use to carri -- dignifi , solid , and reassur . “ well , watson , what do you make of it ? ” holm wa sit with hi back to me , and I had given him no sign of my occup . “ how did you know what I wa do ? I believ you have eye in the back of your head. ” “ I have , at least , a well-polish , silver-pl coffee-pot in front of me , ” said he . “ but , tell me , watson , what do you make of our visitor ’ s stick ? sinc we have been so unfortun as to miss him and have no notion of hi errand , thi accident souvenir becom of import . let me hear you reconstruct the man by an examin of it. ” “ I think , ” said I , follow as far as I could the method of my companion , “ that dr. mortim is a success , elderli medic man , well-esteem sinc those who know him give him thi mark of their appreciation. ” “ good ! ” said holm . “ excel ! ” “ I think also that the probabl is in favour of hi be a countri practition who doe a great deal of hi visit on foot. ” “ whi so ? ” “ becaus thi stick , though origin a veri handsom one ha been so knock about that I can hardli imagin a town practition carri it . the thick-iron ferrul is worn down , so it is evid that he ha done a great amount of walk with it. ” “ perfectli sound ! ” said holm . “ and then again , there is the ‘ friend of the c.c.h. ’ I should guess that to be the someth hunt , the local hunt to whose member he ha possibl given some surgic assist , and which ha made him a small present in return. ” “ realli , watson , you excel yourself , ” said holm , push back hi chair and light a cigarett . “ I am bound to say that in all the account which you have been so good as to give of my own small achiev you have habitu underr your own abil . It may be that you are not yourself lumin , but you are a conductor of light . some peopl without possess geniu have a remark power of stimul it . I confess , my dear fellow , that I am veri much in your debt. ” He had never said as much befor , and I must admit that hi word gave me keen pleasur , for I had often been piqu by hi indiffer to my admir and to the attempt which I had made to give public to hi method . I wa proud , too , to think that I had so far master hi system as to appli it in a way which earn hi approv . He now took the stick from my hand and examin it for a few minut with hi nake eye . then with an express of interest he laid down hi cigarett , and carri the cane to the window , he look over it again with a convex len . “ interest , though elementari , ” said he as he return to hi favourit corner of the sette . “ there are certainli one or two indic upon the stick . It give us the basi for sever deductions. ” “ ha anyth escap me ? ” I ask with some self-import . “ I trust that there is noth of consequ which I have overlook ? ” “ I am afraid , my dear watson , that most of your conclus were erron . when I said that you stimul me I meant , to be frank , that in note your fallaci I wa occasion guid toward the truth . not that you are entir wrong in thi instanc . the man is certainli a countri practition . and he walk a good deal. ” “ then I wa right. ” “ To that extent. ” “ but that wa all. ” “ No , no , my dear watson , not all -- by no mean all . I would suggest , for exampl , that a present to a doctor is more like to come from a hospit than from a hunt , and that when the initi ‘ c.c. ’ are place befor that hospit the word ‘ chare cross ’ veri natur suggest themselves. ” “ you may be right. ” “ the probabl lie in that direct . and if we take thi as a work hypothesi we have a fresh basi from which to start our construct of thi unknown visitor. ” “ well , then , suppos that ‘ c.c.h. ’ doe stand for ‘ chare cross hospit , ’ what further infer may we draw ? ” “ Do none suggest themselv ? you know my method . appli them ! ” “ I can onli think of the obviou conclus that the man ha practis in town befor go to the country. ” “ I think that we might ventur a littl farther than thi . look at it in thi light . On what occas would it be most probabl that such a present would be made ? when would hi friend unit to give him a pledg of their good will ? obvious at the moment when dr. mortim withdrew from the servic of the hospit in order to start a practic for himself . We know there ha been a present . We believ there ha been a chang from a town hospit to a countri practic . Is it , then , stretch our infer too far to say that the present wa on the occas of the chang ? ” “ It certainli seem probable. ” “ now , you will observ that he could not have been on the staff of the hospit , sinc onli a man well-establish in a london practic could hold such a posit , and such a one would not drift into the countri . what wa he , then ? If he wa in the hospit and yet not on the staff he could onli have been a house-surgeon or a house-physician -- littl more than a senior student . and he left five year ago -- the date is on the stick . So your grave , middle-ag famili practition vanish into thin air , my dear watson , and there emerg a young fellow under thirti , amiabl , unambiti , absent-mind , and the possessor of a favourit dog , which I should describ roughli as be larger than a terrier and smaller than a mastiff. ” I laugh incredul as sherlock holm lean back in hi sette and blew littl waver ring of smoke up to the ceil . “ As to the latter part , I have no mean of check you , ” said I , “ but at least it is not difficult to find out a few particular about the man ’ s age and profession career. ” from my small medic shelf I took down the medic directori and turn up the name . there were sever mortim , but onli one who could be our visitor . I read hi record aloud . “ mortim , jame , m.r.c.s. , 1882 , grimpen , dartmoor , devon . house-surgeon , from 1882 to 1884 , at chare cross hospit . winner of the jackson prize for compar patholog , with essay entitl ‘ Is diseas a revers ? ’ correspond member of the swedish patholog societi . author of ‘ some freak of atav ’ ( lancet 1882 ) . ‘ Do We progress ? ’ ( journal of psycholog , march , 1883 ) . medic offic for the parish of grimpen , thorsley , and high barrow. ” “ No mention of that local hunt , watson , ” said holm with a mischiev smile , “ but a countri doctor , as you veri astut observ . I think that I am fairli justifi in my infer . As to the adject , I said , if I rememb right , amiabl , unambiti , and absent-mind . It is my experi that it is onli an amiabl man in thi world who receiv testimoni , onli an unambiti one who abandon a london career for the countri , and onli an absent-mind one who leav hi stick and not hi visiting-card after wait an hour in your room. ” “ and the dog ? ” “ ha been in the habit of carri thi stick behind hi master . be a heavi stick the dog ha held it tightli by the middl , and the mark of hi teeth are veri plainli visibl . the dog ’ s jaw , as shown in the space between these mark , is too broad in my opinion for a terrier and not broad enough for a mastiff . It may have been -- ye , by jove , it is a curly-hair spaniel. ” He had risen and pace the room as he spoke . now he halt in the recess of the window . there wa such a ring of convict in hi voic that I glanc up in surpris . “ My dear fellow , how can you possibl be so sure of that ? ” “ for the veri simpl reason that I see the dog himself on our veri door-step , and there is the ring of it owner . don ’ t move , I beg you , watson . He is a profession brother of your , and your presenc may be of assist to me . now is the dramat moment of fate , watson , when you hear a step upon the stair which is walk into your life , and you know not whether for good or ill. what doe dr. jame mortim , the man of scienc , ask of sherlock holm , the specialist in crime ? come in ! ” the appear of our visitor wa a surpris to me , sinc I had expect a typic countri practition . He wa a veri tall , thin man , with a long nose like a beak , which jut out between two keen , gray eye , set close togeth and sparkl brightli from behind a pair of gold-rim glass . He wa clad in a profession but rather slovenli fashion , for hi frock-coat wa dingi and hi trouser fray . though young , hi long back wa alreadi bow , and he walk with a forward thrust of hi head and a gener air of peer benevol . As he enter hi eye fell upon the stick in holm ’ s hand , and he ran toward it with an exclam of joy . “ I am so veri glad , ” said he . “ I wa not sure whether I had left it here or in the ship offic . I would not lose that stick for the world. ” “ A present , I see , ” said holm . “ ye , sir. ” “ from chare cross hospit ? ” “ from one or two friend there on the occas of my marriage. ” “ dear , dear , that ’ s bad ! ” said holm , shake hi head . dr. mortim blink through hi glass in mild astonish . “ whi wa it bad ? ” “ onli that you have disarrang our littl deduct . your marriag , you say ? ” “ ye , sir . I marri , and so left the hospit , and with it all hope of a consult practic . It wa necessari to make a home of my own. ” “ come , come , we are not so far wrong , after all , ” said holm . “ and now , dr. jame mortim -- ” “ mister , sir , mister -- a humbl m.r.c.s. ” “ and a man of precis mind , evidently. ” “ A dabbler in scienc , mr. holm , a picker up of shell on the shore of the great unknown ocean . I presum that it is mr. sherlock holm whom I am address and not -- ” “ No , thi is my friend dr. watson. ” “ glad to meet you , sir . I have heard your name mention in connect with that of your friend . you interest me veri much , mr. holm . I had hardli expect so dolichocephal a skull or such well-mark supra-orbit develop . would you have ani object to my run my finger along your pariet fissur ? A cast of your skull , sir , until the origin is avail , would be an ornament to ani anthropolog museum . It is not my intent to be fulsom , but I confess that I covet your skull. ” sherlock holm wave our strang visitor into a chair . “ you are an enthusiast in your line of thought , I perceiv , sir , as I am in mine , ” said he . “ I observ from your forefing that you make your own cigarett . have no hesit in light one. ” the man drew out paper and tobacco and twirl the one up in the other with surpris dexter . He had long , quiver finger as agil and restless as the antenna of an insect . holm wa silent , but hi littl dart glanc show me the interest which he took in our curiou companion . “ I presum , sir , ” said he at last , “ that it wa not mere for the purpos of examin my skull that you have done me the honour to call here last night and again today ? ” “ No , sir , no ; though I am happi to have had the opportun of do that as well . I came to you , mr. holm , becaus I recogn that I am myself an unpract man and becaus I am suddenli confront with a most seriou and extraordinari problem . recogn , as I do , that you are the second highest expert in europ -- ” “ inde , sir ! may I inquir who ha the honour to be the first ? ” ask holm with some asper . “ To the man of precis scientif mind the work of monsieur bertillon must alway appeal strongly. ” “ then had you not better consult him ? ” “ I said , sir , to the precis scientif mind . but as a practic man of affair it is acknowledg that you stand alon . I trust , sir , that I have not inadvert -- ” “ just a littl , ” said holm . “ I think , dr. mortim , you would do wise if without more ado you would kindli tell me plainli what the exact natur of the problem is in which you demand my assistance. ” chapter 2 . the curs of the baskervil “ I have in my pocket a manuscript , ” said dr. jame mortim . “ I observ it as you enter the room , ” said holm . “ It is an old manuscript. ” “ earli eighteenth centuri , unless it is a forgery. ” “ how can you say that , sir ? ” “ you have present an inch or two of it to my examin all the time that you have been talk . It would be a poor expert who could not give the date of a document within a decad or so . you may possibl have read my littl monograph upon the subject . I put that at 1730. ” “ the exact date is 1742. ” dr. mortim drew it from hi breast-pocket . “ thi famili paper wa commit to my care by sir charl baskervil , whose sudden and tragic death some three month ago creat so much excit in devonshir . I may say that I wa hi person friend as well as hi medic attend . He wa a strong-mind man , sir , shrewd , practic , and as unimagin as I am myself . yet he took thi document veri serious , and hi mind wa prepar for just such an end as did eventu overtak him. ” holm stretch out hi hand for the manuscript and flatten it upon hi knee . “ you will observ , watson , the altern use of the long s and the short . It is one of sever indic which enabl me to fix the date. ” I look over hi shoulder at the yellow paper and the fade script . At the head wa written : “ baskervil hall , ” and below in larg , scrawl figur : “ 1742. ” “ It appear to be a statement of some sort. ” “ ye , it is a statement of a certain legend which run in the baskervil family. ” “ but I understand that it is someth more modern and practic upon which you wish to consult me ? ” “ most modern . A most practic , press matter , which must be decid within twenty-four hour . but the manuscript is short and is intim connect with the affair . with your permiss I will read it to you. ” holm lean back in hi chair , place hi finger-tip togeth , and close hi eye , with an air of resign . dr. mortim turn the manuscript to the light and read in a high , crack voic the follow curiou , old-world narr : “ Of the origin of the hound of the baskervil there have been mani statement , yet as I come in a direct line from hugo baskervil , and as I had the stori from my father , who also had it from hi , I have set it down with all belief that it occur even as is here set forth . and I would have you believ , my son , that the same justic which punish sin may also most gracious forgiv it , and that no ban is so heavi but that by prayer and repent it may be remov . learn then from thi stori not to fear the fruit of the past , but rather to be circumspect in the futur , that those foul passion wherebi our famili ha suffer so grievous may not again be loos to our undo . “ know then that in the time of the great rebellion ( the histori of which by the learn lord clarendon I most earnestli commend to your attent ) thi manor of baskervil wa held by hugo of that name , nor can it be gainsaid that he wa a most wild , profan , and godless man . thi , in truth , hi neighbour might have pardon , see that saint have never flourish in those part , but there wa in him a certain wanton and cruel humour which made hi name a by-word through the west . It chanc that thi hugo came to love ( if , inde , so dark a passion may be known under so bright a name ) the daughter of a yeoman who held land near the baskervil estat . but the young maiden , be discreet and of good reput , would ever avoid him , for she fear hi evil name . So it came to pass that one michaelma thi hugo , with five or six of hi idl and wick companion , stole down upon the farm and carri off the maiden , her father and brother be from home , as he well knew . when they had brought her to the hall the maiden wa place in an upper chamber , while hugo and hi friend sat down to a long carous , as wa their nightli custom . now , the poor lass upstair wa like to have her wit turn at the sing and shout and terribl oath which came up to her from below , for they say that the word use by hugo baskervil , when he wa in wine , were such as might blast the man who said them . At last in the stress of her fear she did that which might have daunt the bravest or most activ man , for by the aid of the growth of ivi which cover ( and still cover ) the south wall she came down from under the eav , and so homeward across the moor , there be three leagu betwixt the hall and her father ’ s farm . “ It chanc that some littl time later hugo left hi guest to carri food and drink -- with other wors thing , perchanc -- to hi captiv , and so found the cage empti and the bird escap . then , as it would seem , he becam as one that hath a devil , for , rush down the stair into the dining-hal , he sprang upon the great tabl , flagon and trencher fli befor him , and he cri aloud befor all the compani that he would that veri night render hi bodi and soul to the power of evil if he might but overtak the wench . and while the revel stood aghast at the furi of the man , one more wick or , it may be , more drunken than the rest , cri out that they should put the hound upon her . whereat hugo ran from the hous , cri to hi groom that they should saddl hi mare and unkennel the pack , and give the hound a kerchief of the maid ’ s , he swung them to the line , and so off full cri in the moonlight over the moor . “ now , for some space the revel stood agap , unabl to understand all that had been done in such hast . but anon their bemus wit awok to the natur of the deed which wa like to be done upon the moorland . everyth wa now in an uproar , some call for their pistol , some for their hors , and some for anoth flask of wine . but at length some sens came back to their craze mind , and the whole of them , thirteen in number , took hors and start in pursuit . the moon shone clear abov them , and they rode swiftli abreast , take that cours which the maid must need have taken if she were to reach her own home . “ they had gone a mile or two when they pass one of the night shepherd upon the moorland , and they cri to him to know if he had seen the hunt . and the man , as the stori goe , wa so craze with fear that he could scarc speak , but at last he said that he had inde seen the unhappi maiden , with the hound upon her track . ‘ but I have seen more than that , ’ said he , ‘ for hugo baskervil pass me upon hi black mare , and there ran mute behind him such a hound of hell as god forbid should ever be at my heels. ’ So the drunken squir curs the shepherd and rode onward . but soon their skin turn cold , for there came a gallop across the moor , and the black mare , dabbl with white froth , went past with trail bridl and empti saddl . then the revel rode close togeth , for a great fear wa on them , but they still follow over the moor , though each , had he been alon , would have been right glad to have turn hi hors ’ s head . ride slowli in thi fashion they came at last upon the hound . these , though known for their valour and their breed , were whimper in a cluster at the head of a deep dip or goyal , as we call it , upon the moor , some slink away and some , with start hackl and stare eye , gaze down the narrow valley befor them . “ the compani had come to a halt , more sober men , as you may guess , than when they start . the most of them would by no mean advanc , but three of them , the boldest , or it may be the most drunken , rode forward down the goyal . now , it open into a broad space in which stood two of those great stone , still to be seen there , which were set by certain forgotten peopl in the day of old . the moon wa shine bright upon the clear , and there in the centr lay the unhappi maid where she had fallen , dead of fear and of fatigu . but it wa not the sight of her bodi , nor yet wa it that of the bodi of hugo baskervil lie near her , which rais the hair upon the head of these three dare-devil royster , but it wa that , stand over hugo , and pluck at hi throat , there stood a foul thing , a great , black beast , shape like a hound , yet larger than ani hound that ever mortal eye ha rest upon . and even as they look the thing tore the throat out of hugo baskervil , on which , as it turn it blaze eye and drip jaw upon them , the three shriek with fear and rode for dear life , still scream , across the moor . one , it is said , die that veri night of what he had seen , and the other twain were but broken men for the rest of their day . “ such is the tale , my son , of the come of the hound which is said to have plagu the famili so sore ever sinc . If I have set it down it is becaus that which is clearli known hath less terror than that which is but hint at and guess . nor can it be deni that mani of the famili have been unhappi in their death , which have been sudden , bloodi , and mysteri . yet may we shelter ourselv in the infinit good of provid , which would not forev punish the innoc beyond that third or fourth gener which is threaten in holi writ . To that provid , my son , I herebi commend you , and I counsel you by way of caution to forbear from cross the moor in those dark hour when the power of evil are exalt . “ [ thi from hugo baskervil to hi son rodger and john , with instruct that they say noth thereof to their sister elizabeth . ] ” when dr. mortim had finish read thi singular narr he push hi spectacl up on hi forehead and stare across at mr. sherlock holm . the latter yawn and toss the end of hi cigarett into the fire . “ well ? ” said he . “ Do you not find it interest ? ” “ To a collector of fairi tales. ” dr. mortim drew a fold newspap out of hi pocket . “ now , mr. holm , we will give you someth a littl more recent . thi is the devon counti chronicl of may 14th of thi year . It is a short account of the fact elicit at the death of sir charl baskervil which occur a few day befor that date. ” My friend lean a littl forward and hi express becam intent . our visitor readjust hi glass and began : “ the recent sudden death of sir charl baskervil , whose name ha been mention as the probabl liber candid for mid-devon at the next elect , ha cast a gloom over the counti . though sir charl had resid at baskervil hall for a compar short period hi amiabl of charact and extrem generos had won the affect and respect of all who had been brought into contact with him . In these day of nouveaux rich it is refresh to find a case where the scion of an old counti famili which ha fallen upon evil day is abl to make hi own fortun and to bring it back with him to restor the fallen grandeur of hi line . sir charl , as is well known , made larg sum of money in south african specul . more wise than those who go on until the wheel turn against them , he realiz hi gain and return to england with them . It is onli two year sinc he took up hi resid at baskervil hall , and it is common talk how larg were those scheme of reconstruct and improv which have been interrupt by hi death . be himself childless , it wa hi openli express desir that the whole countrysid should , within hi own lifetim , profit by hi good fortun , and mani will have person reason for bewail hi untim end . hi gener donat to local and counti chariti have been frequent chronicl in these column . “ the circumst connect with the death of sir charl can not be said to have been entir clear up by the inquest , but at least enough ha been done to dispos of those rumour to which local superstit ha given rise . there is no reason whatev to suspect foul play , or to imagin that death could be from ani but natur caus . sir charl wa a widow , and a man who may be said to have been in some way of an eccentr habit of mind . In spite of hi consider wealth he wa simpl in hi person tast , and hi indoor servant at baskervil hall consist of a marri coupl name barrymor , the husband act as butler and the wife as housekeep . their evid , corrobor by that of sever friend , tend to show that sir charl ’ s health ha for some time been impair , and point especi to some affect of the heart , manifest itself in chang of colour , breathless , and acut attack of nervou depress . dr. jame mortim , the friend and medic attend of the deceas , ha given evid to the same effect . “ the fact of the case are simpl . sir charl baskervil wa in the habit everi night befor go to bed of walk down the famou yew alley of baskervil hall . the evid of the barrymor show that thi had been hi custom . On the fourth of may sir charl had declar hi intent of start next day for london , and had order barrymor to prepar hi luggag . that night he went out as usual for hi nocturn walk , in the cours of which he wa in the habit of smoke a cigar . He never return . At twelv o ’ clock barrymor , find the hall door still open , becam alarm , and , light a lantern , went in search of hi master . the day had been wet , and sir charl ’ s footmark were easili trace down the alley . halfway down thi walk there is a gate which lead out on to the moor . there were indic that sir charl had stood for some littl time here . He then proceed down the alley , and it wa at the far end of it that hi bodi wa discov . one fact which ha not been explain is the statement of barrymor that hi master ’ s footprint alter their charact from the time that he pass the moor-gat , and that he appear from thenc onward to have been walk upon hi toe . one murphi , a gipsi horse-deal , wa on the moor at no great distanc at the time , but he appear by hi own confess to have been the wors for drink . He declar that he heard cri but is unabl to state from what direct they came . No sign of violenc were to be discov upon sir charl ’ s person , and though the doctor ’ s evid point to an almost incred facial distort -- so great that dr. mortim refus at first to believ that it wa inde hi friend and patient who lay befor him -- it wa explain that that is a symptom which is not unusu in case of dyspnoea and death from cardiac exhaust . thi explan wa born out by the post-mortem examin , which show long-stand organ diseas , and the coron ’ s juri return a verdict in accord with the medic evid . It is well that thi is so , for it is obvious of the utmost import that sir charl ’ s heir should settl at the hall and continu the good work which ha been so sadli interrupt . had the prosaic find of the coron not final put an end to the romant stori which have been whisper in connect with the affair , it might have been difficult to find a tenant for baskervil hall . It is understood that the next of kin is mr. henri baskervil , if he be still aliv , the son of sir charl baskervil ’ s younger brother . the young man when last heard of wa in america , and inquiri are be institut with a view to inform him of hi good fortune. ” dr. mortim refold hi paper and replac it in hi pocket . “ those are the public fact , mr. holm , in connect with the death of sir charl baskerville. ” “ I must thank you , ” said sherlock holm , “ for call my attent to a case which certainli present some featur of interest . I had observ some newspap comment at the time , but I wa exceedingli preoccupi by that littl affair of the vatican cameo , and in my anxieti to oblig the pope I lost touch with sever interest english case . thi articl , you say , contain all the public fact ? ” “ It does. ” “ then let me have the privat ones. ” He lean back , put hi finger-tip togeth , and assum hi most impass and judici express . “ In do so , ” said dr. mortim , who had begun to show sign of some strong emot , “ I am tell that which I have not confid to anyon . My motiv for withhold it from the coron ’ s inquiri is that a man of scienc shrink from place himself in the public posit of seem to indors a popular superstit . I had the further motiv that baskervil hall , as the paper say , would certainli remain unten if anyth were done to increas it alreadi rather grim reput . for both these reason I thought that I wa justifi in tell rather less than I knew , sinc no practic good could result from it , but with you there is no reason whi I should not be perfectli frank . “ the moor is veri spars inhabit , and those who live near each other are thrown veri much togeth . for thi reason I saw a good deal of sir charl baskervil . with the except of mr. frankland , of lafter hall , and mr. stapleton , the naturalist , there are no other men of educ within mani mile . sir charl wa a retir man , but the chanc of hi ill brought us togeth , and a commun of interest in scienc kept us so . He had brought back much scientif inform from south africa , and mani a charm even we have spent togeth discuss the compar anatomi of the bushman and the hottentot . “ within the last few month it becam increasingli plain to me that sir charl ’ s nervou system wa strain to the break point . He had taken thi legend which I have read you exceedingli to heart -- so much so that , although he would walk in hi own ground , noth would induc him to go out upon the moor at night . incred as it may appear to you , mr. holm , he wa honestli convinc that a dread fate overhung hi famili , and certainli the record which he wa abl to give of hi ancestor were not encourag . the idea of some ghastli presenc constantli haunt him , and on more than one occas he ha ask me whether I had on my medic journey at night ever seen ani strang creatur or heard the bay of a hound . the latter question he put to me sever time , and alway with a voic which vibrat with excit . “ I can well rememb drive up to hi hous in the even some three week befor the fatal event . He chanc to be at hi hall door . I had descend from my gig and wa stand in front of him , when I saw hi eye fix themselv over my shoulder and stare past me with an express of the most dread horror . I whisk round and had just time to catch a glimps of someth which I took to be a larg black calf pass at the head of the drive . So excit and alarm wa he that I wa compel to go down to the spot where the anim had been and look around for it . It wa gone , howev , and the incid appear to make the worst impress upon hi mind . I stay with him all the even , and it wa on that occas , to explain the emot which he had shown , that he confid to my keep that narr which I read to you when first I came . I mention thi small episod becaus it assum some import in view of the tragedi which follow , but I wa convinc at the time that the matter wa entir trivial and that hi excit had no justif . “ It wa at my advic that sir charl wa about to go to london . hi heart wa , I knew , affect , and the constant anxieti in which he live , howev chimer the caus of it might be , wa evid have a seriou effect upon hi health . I thought that a few month among the distract of town would send him back a new man . mr. stapleton , a mutual friend who wa much concern at hi state of health , wa of the same opinion . At the last instant came thi terribl catastroph . “ On the night of sir charl ’ s death barrymor the butler , who made the discoveri , sent perkin the groom on horseback to me , and as I wa sit up late I wa abl to reach baskervil hall within an hour of the event . I check and corrobor all the fact which were mention at the inquest . I follow the footstep down the yew alley , I saw the spot at the moor-gat where he seem to have wait , I remark the chang in the shape of the print after that point , I note that there were no other footstep save those of barrymor on the soft gravel , and final I care examin the bodi , which had not been touch until my arriv . sir charl lay on hi face , hi arm out , hi finger dug into the ground , and hi featur convuls with some strong emot to such an extent that I could hardli have sworn to hi ident . there wa certainli no physic injuri of ani kind . but one fals statement wa made by barrymor at the inquest . He said that there were no trace upon the ground round the bodi . He did not observ ani . but I did -- some littl distanc off , but fresh and clear. ” “ footprint ? ” “ footprints. ” “ A man ’ s or a woman ’ s ? ” dr. mortim look strang at us for an instant , and hi voic sank almost to a whisper as he answer . “ Mr . holm , they were the footprint of a gigant hound ! ” chapter 3 . the problem I confess at these word a shudder pass through me . there wa a thrill in the doctor ’ s voic which show that he wa himself deepli move by that which he told us . holm lean forward in hi excit and hi eye had the hard , dri glitter which shot from them when he wa keenli interest . “ you saw thi ? ” “ As clearli as I see you. ” “ and you said noth ? ” “ what wa the use ? ” “ how wa it that no one els saw it ? ” “ the mark were some twenti yard from the bodi and no one gave them a thought . I don ’ t suppos I should have done so had I not known thi legend. ” “ there are mani sheep-dog on the moor ? ” “ No doubt , but thi wa no sheep-dog. ” “ you say it wa larg ? ” “ enormous. ” “ but it had not approach the bodi ? ” “ no. ” “ what sort of night wa it ? ’ “ damp and raw. ” “ but not actual rain ? ” “ no. ” “ what is the alley like ? ” “ there are two line of old yew hedg , twelv feet high and impenetr . the walk in the centr is about eight feet across. ” “ Is there anyth between the hedg and the walk ? ” “ ye , there is a strip of grass about six feet broad on either side. ” “ I understand that the yew hedg is penetr at one point by a gate ? ” “ ye , the wicket-g which lead on to the moor. ” “ Is there ani other open ? ” “ none. ” “ So that to reach the yew alley one either ha to come down it from the hous or els to enter it by the moor-gat ? ” “ there is an exit through a summer-hous at the far end. ” “ had sir charl reach thi ? ” “ No ; he lay about fifti yard from it. ” “ now , tell me , dr. mortim -- and thi is import -- the mark which you saw were on the path and not on the grass ? ” “ No mark could show on the grass. ” “ were they on the same side of the path as the moor-gat ? ” “ ye ; they were on the edg of the path on the same side as the moor-gate. ” “ you interest me exceedingli . anoth point . wa the wicket-g close ? ” “ close and padlocked. ” “ how high wa it ? ” “ about four feet high. ” “ then anyon could have got over it ? ” “ yes. ” “ and what mark did you see by the wicket-g ? ” “ none in particular. ” “ good heaven ! did no one examin ? ” “ ye , I examin , myself. ” “ and found noth ? ” “ It wa all veri confus . sir charl had evid stood there for five or ten minutes. ” “ how do you know that ? ” “ becaus the ash had twice drop from hi cigar. ” “ excel ! thi is a colleagu , watson , after our own heart . but the mark ? ” “ He had left hi own mark all over that small patch of gravel . I could discern no others. ” sherlock holm struck hi hand against hi knee with an impati gestur . “ If I had onli been there ! ” he cri . “ It is evid a case of extraordinari interest , and one which present immens opportun to the scientif expert . that gravel page upon which I might have read so much ha been long ere thi smudg by the rain and defac by the clog of curiou peasant . Oh , dr. mortim , dr. mortim , to think that you should not have call me in ! you have inde much to answer for. ” “ I could not call you in , mr. holm , without disclos these fact to the world , and I have alreadi given my reason for not wish to do so . besid , besid -- ” “ whi do you hesit ? ” “ there is a realm in which the most acut and most experienc of detect is helpless. ” “ you mean that the thing is supernatur ? ” “ I did not posit say so. ” “ No , but you evid think it. ” “ sinc the tragedi , mr. holm , there have come to my ear sever incid which are hard to reconcil with the settl order of nature. ” “ for exampl ? ” “ I find that befor the terribl event occur sever peopl had seen a creatur upon the moor which correspond with thi baskervil demon , and which could not possibl be ani anim known to scienc . they all agre that it wa a huge creatur , lumin , ghastli , and spectral . I have cross-examin these men , one of them a hard-head countryman , one a farrier , and one a moorland farmer , who all tell the same stori of thi dread apparit , exactli correspond to the hell-hound of the legend . I assur you that there is a reign of terror in the district , and that it is a hardi man who will cross the moor at night. ” “ and you , a train man of scienc , believ it to be supernatur ? ” “ I do not know what to believe. ” holm shrug hi shoulder . “ I have hitherto confin my investig to thi world , ” said he . “ In a modest way I have combat evil , but to take on the father of evil himself would , perhap , be too ambiti a task . yet you must admit that the footmark is material. ” “ the origin hound wa materi enough to tug a man ’ s throat out , and yet he wa diabol as well. ” “ I see that you have quit gone over to the supernaturalist . but now , dr. mortim , tell me thi . If you hold these view , whi have you come to consult me at all ? you tell me in the same breath that it is useless to investig sir charl ’ s death , and that you desir me to do it. ” “ I did not say that I desir you to do it. ” “ then , how can I assist you ? ” “ By advis me as to what I should do with sir henri baskervil , who arriv at waterloo station ” -- dr. mortim look at hi watch -- “ in exactli one hour and a quarter. ” “ He be the heir ? ” “ ye . On the death of sir charl we inquir for thi young gentleman and found that he had been farm in canada . from the account which have reach us he is an excel fellow in everi way . I speak now not as a medic man but as a truste and executor of sir charl ’ s will. ” “ there is no other claimant , I presum ? ” “ none . the onli other kinsman whom we have been abl to trace wa rodger baskervil , the youngest of three brother of whom poor sir charl wa the elder . the second brother , who die young , is the father of thi lad henri . the third , rodger , wa the black sheep of the famili . He came of the old master baskervil strain and wa the veri imag , they tell me , of the famili pictur of old hugo . He made england too hot to hold him , fled to central america , and die there in 1876 of yellow fever . henri is the last of the baskervil . In one hour and five minut I meet him at waterloo station . I have had a wire that he arriv at southampton thi morn . now , mr. holm , what would you advis me to do with him ? ” “ whi should he not go to the home of hi father ? ” “ It seem natur , doe it not ? and yet , consid that everi baskervil who goe there meet with an evil fate . I feel sure that if sir charl could have spoken with me befor hi death he would have warn me against bring thi , the last of the old race , and the heir to great wealth , to that deadli place . and yet it can not be deni that the prosper of the whole poor , bleak countrysid depend upon hi presenc . all the good work which ha been done by sir charl will crash to the ground if there is no tenant of the hall . I fear lest I should be sway too much by my own obviou interest in the matter , and that is whi I bring the case befor you and ask for your advice. ” holm consid for a littl time . “ put into plain word , the matter is thi , ” said he . “ In your opinion there is a diabol agenc which make dartmoor an unsaf abod for a baskervil -- that is your opinion ? ” “ At least I might go the length of say that there is some evid that thi may be so. ” “ exactli . but sure , if your supernatur theori be correct , it could work the young man evil in london as easili as in devonshir . A devil with mere local power like a parish vestri would be too inconceiv a thing. ” “ you put the matter more flippantli , mr. holm , than you would probabl do if you were brought into person contact with these thing . your advic , then , as I understand it , is that the young man will be as safe in devonshir as in london . He come in fifti minut . what would you recommend ? ” “ I recommend , sir , that you take a cab , call off your spaniel who is scratch at my front door , and proceed to waterloo to meet sir henri baskerville. ” “ and then ? ” “ and then you will say noth to him at all until I have made up my mind about the matter. ” “ how long will it take you to make up your mind ? ” “ twenty-four hour . At ten o ’ clock tomorrow , dr. mortim , I will be much oblig to you if you will call upon me here , and it will be of help to me in my plan for the futur if you will bring sir henri baskervil with you. ” “ I will do so , mr. holmes. ” He scribbl the appoint on hi shirt-cuff and hurri off in hi strang , peer , absent-mind fashion . holm stop him at the head of the stair . “ onli one more question , dr. mortim . you say that befor sir charl baskervil ’ s death sever peopl saw thi apparit upon the moor ? ” “ three peopl did. ” “ did ani see it after ? ” “ I have not heard of any. ” “ thank you . good-morning. ” holm return to hi seat with that quiet look of inward satisfact which meant that he had a congeni task befor him . “ go out , watson ? ” “ unless I can help you. ” “ No , my dear fellow , it is at the hour of action that I turn to you for aid . but thi is splendid , realli uniqu from some point of view . when you pass bradley ’ s , would you ask him to send up a pound of the strongest shag tobacco ? thank you . It would be as well if you could make it conveni not to return befor even . then I should be veri glad to compar impress as to thi most interest problem which ha been submit to us thi morning. ” I knew that seclus and solitud were veri necessari for my friend in those hour of intens mental concentr dure which he weigh everi particl of evid , construct altern theori , balanc one against the other , and made up hi mind as to which point were essenti and which immateri . I therefor spent the day at my club and did not return to baker street until even . It wa nearli nine o ’ clock when I found myself in the sitting-room onc more . My first impress as I open the door wa that a fire had broken out , for the room wa so fill with smoke that the light of the lamp upon the tabl wa blur by it . As I enter , howev , my fear were set at rest , for it wa the acrid fume of strong coars tobacco which took me by the throat and set me cough . through the haze I had a vagu vision of holm in hi dressing-gown coil up in an armchair with hi black clay pipe between hi lip . sever roll of paper lay around him . “ caught cold , watson ? ” said he . “ No , it ’ s thi poison atmosphere. ” “ I suppos it is pretti thick , now that you mention it. ” “ thick ! It is intolerable. ” “ open the window , then ! you have been at your club all day , I perceive. ” “ My dear holm ! ” “ Am I right ? ” “ certainli , but how ? ” He laugh at my bewild express . “ there is a delight fresh about you , watson , which make it a pleasur to exercis ani small power which I possess at your expens . A gentleman goe forth on a showeri and miri day . He return immacul in the even with the gloss still on hi hat and hi boot . He ha been a fixtur therefor all day . He is not a man with intim friend . where , then , could he have been ? Is it not obviou ? ” “ well , it is rather obvious. ” “ the world is full of obviou thing which nobodi by ani chanc ever observ . where do you think that I have been ? ” “ A fixtur also. ” “ On the contrari , I have been to devonshire. ” “ In spirit ? ” “ exactli . My bodi ha remain in thi armchair and ha , I regret to observ , consum in my absenc two larg pot of coffe and an incred amount of tobacco . after you left I sent down to stamford ’ s for the ordnanc map of thi portion of the moor , and my spirit ha hover over it all day . I flatter myself that I could find my way about. ” “ A large-scal map , I presum ? ” “ veri large. ” He unrol one section and held it over hi knee . “ here you have the particular district which concern us . that is baskervil hall in the middle. ” “ with a wood round it ? ” “ exactli . I fanci the yew alley , though not mark under that name , must stretch along thi line , with the moor , as you perceiv , upon the right of it . thi small clump of build here is the hamlet of grimpen , where our friend dr. mortim ha hi headquart . within a radiu of five mile there are , as you see , onli a veri few scatter dwell . here is lafter hall , which wa mention in the narr . there is a hous indic here which may be the resid of the naturalist -- stapleton , if I rememb right , wa hi name . here are two moorland farmhous , high tor and foulmir . then fourteen mile away the great convict prison of princetown . between and around these scatter point extend the desol , lifeless moor . thi , then , is the stage upon which tragedi ha been play , and upon which we may help to play it again. ” “ It must be a wild place. ” “ ye , the set is a worthi one . If the devil did desir to have a hand in the affair of men -- ” “ then you are yourself inclin to the supernatur explanation. ” “ the devil ’ s agent may be of flesh and blood , may they not ? there are two question wait for us at the outset . the one is whether ani crime ha been commit at all ; the second is , what is the crime and how wa it commit ? Of cours , if dr. mortim ’ s surmis should be correct , and we are deal with forc outsid the ordinari law of natur , there is an end of our investig . but we are bound to exhaust all other hypothes befor fall back upon thi one . I think we ’ ll shut that window again , if you don ’ t mind . It is a singular thing , but I find that a concentr atmospher help a concentr of thought . I have not push it to the length of get into a box to think , but that is the logic outcom of my convict . have you turn the case over in your mind ? ” “ ye , I have thought a good deal of it in the cours of the day. ” “ what do you make of it ? ” “ It is veri bewildering. ” “ It ha certainli a charact of it own . there are point of distinct about it . that chang in the footprint , for exampl . what do you make of that ? ” “ mortim said that the man had walk on tipto down that portion of the alley. ” “ He onli repeat what some fool had said at the inquest . whi should a man walk on tipto down the alley ? ” “ what then ? ” “ He wa run , watson -- run desper , run for hi life , run until he burst hi heart -- and fell dead upon hi face. ” “ run from what ? ” “ there lie our problem . there are indic that the man wa craze with fear befor ever he began to run. ” “ how can you say that ? ” “ I am presum that the caus of hi fear came to him across the moor . If that were so , and it seem most probabl , onli a man who had lost hi wit would have run from the hous instead of toward it . If the gipsi ’ s evid may be taken as true , he ran with cri for help in the direct where help wa least like to be . then , again , whom wa he wait for that night , and whi wa he wait for him in the yew alley rather than in hi own hous ? ” “ you think that he wa wait for someon ? ” “ the man wa elderli and infirm . We can understand hi take an even stroll , but the ground wa damp and the night inclement . Is it natur that he should stand for five or ten minut , as dr. mortim , with more practic sens than I should have given him credit for , deduc from the cigar ash ? ” “ but he went out everi evening. ” “ I think it unlik that he wait at the moor-gat everi even . On the contrari , the evid is that he avoid the moor . that night he wait there . It wa the night befor he made hi departur for london . the thing take shape , watson . It becom coher . might I ask you to hand me my violin , and we will postpon all further thought upon thi busi until we have had the advantag of meet dr. mortim and sir henri baskervil in the morning. ” chapter 4 . sir henri baskervil our breakfast tabl wa clear earli , and holm wait in hi dressing-gown for the promis interview . our client were punctual to their appoint , for the clock had just struck ten when dr. mortim wa shown up , follow by the young baronet . the latter wa a small , alert , dark-ey man about thirti year of age , veri sturdili built , with thick black eyebrow and a strong , pugnaci face . He wore a ruddy-tint tweed suit and had the weather-beaten appear of one who ha spent most of hi time in the open air , and yet there wa someth in hi steadi eye and the quiet assur of hi bear which indic the gentleman . “ thi is sir henri baskervil , ” said dr. mortim . “ whi , ye , ” said he , “ and the strang thing is , mr. sherlock holm , that if my friend here had not propos come round to you thi morn I should have come on my own account . I understand that you think out littl puzzl , and I ’ ve had one thi morn which want more think out than I am abl to give it. ” “ pray take a seat , sir henri . Do I understand you to say that you have yourself had some remark experi sinc you arriv in london ? ” “ noth of much import , mr. holm . onli a joke , as like as not . It wa thi letter , if you can call it a letter , which reach me thi morning. ” He laid an envelop upon the tabl , and we all bent over it . It wa of common qualiti , grayish in colour . the address , “ sir henri baskervil , northumberland hotel , ” wa print in rough charact ; the post-mark “ chare cross , ” and the date of post the preced even . “ who knew that you were go to the northumberland hotel ? ” ask holm , glanc keenli across at our visitor . “ No one could have known . We onli decid after I met dr. mortimer. ” “ but dr. mortim wa no doubt alreadi stop there ? ” “ No , I had been stay with a friend , ” said the doctor . “ there wa no possibl indic that we intend to go to thi hotel. ” “ hum ! someon seem to be veri deepli interest in your movements. ” out of the envelop he took a half-sheet of foolscap paper fold into four . thi he open and spread flat upon the tabl . across the middl of it a singl sentenc had been form by the expedi of past print word upon it . It ran : As you valu your life or your reason keep away from the moor . the word “ moor ” onli wa print in ink . “ now , ” said sir henri baskervil , “ perhap you will tell me , mr. holm , what in thunder is the mean of that , and who it is that take so much interest in my affair ? ” “ what do you make of it , dr. mortim ? you must allow that there is noth supernatur about thi , at ani rate ? ” “ No , sir , but it might veri well come from someon who wa convinc that the busi is supernatural. ” “ what busi ? ” ask sir henri sharpli . “ It seem to me that all you gentlemen know a great deal more than I do about my own affairs. ” “ you shall share our knowledg befor you leav thi room , sir henri . I promis you that , ” said sherlock holm . “ We will confin ourselv for the present with your permiss to thi veri interest document , which must have been put togeth and post yesterday even . have you yesterday ’ s time , watson ? ” “ It is here in the corner. ” “ might I troubl you for it -- the insid page , pleas , with the lead articl ? ” He glanc swiftli over it , run hi eye up and down the column . “ capit articl thi on free trade . permit me to give you an extract from it . ‘ you may be cajol into imagin that your own special trade or your own industri will be encourag by a protect tariff , but it stand to reason that such legisl must in the long run keep away wealth from the countri , diminish the valu of our import , and lower the gener condit of life in thi island. ’ “ what do you think of that , watson ? ” cri holm in high glee , rub hi hand togeth with satisfact . “ don ’ t you think that is an admir sentiment ? ” dr. mortim look at holm with an air of profession interest , and sir henri baskervil turn a pair of puzzl dark eye upon me . “ I don ’ t know much about the tariff and thing of that kind , ” said he , “ but it seem to me we ’ ve got a bit off the trail so far as that note is concerned. ” “ On the contrari , I think we are particularli hot upon the trail , sir henri . watson here know more about my method than you do , but I fear that even he ha not quit grasp the signific of thi sentence. ” “ No , I confess that I see no connection. ” “ and yet , my dear watson , there is so veri close a connect that the one is extract out of the other . ‘ you , ’ ‘ your , ’ ‘ your , ’ ‘ life , ’ ‘ reason , ’ ‘ valu , ’ ‘ keep away , ’ ‘ from the. ’ don ’ t you see now whenc these word have been taken ? ” “ By thunder , you ’ re right ! well , if that isn ’ t smart ! ” cri sir henri . “ If ani possibl doubt remain it is settl by the fact that ‘ keep away ’ and ‘ from the ’ are cut out in one piece. ” “ well , now -- so it is ! ” “ realli , mr. holm , thi exce anyth which I could have imagin , ” said dr. mortim , gaze at my friend in amaz . “ I could understand anyon say that the word were from a newspap ; but that you should name which , and add that it came from the lead articl , is realli one of the most remark thing which I have ever known . how did you do it ? ” “ I presum , doctor , that you could tell the skull of a negro from that of an esquimau ? ” “ most certainly. ” “ but how ? ” “ becaus that is my special hobbi . the differ are obviou . the supra-orbit crest , the facial angl , the maxillari curv , the -- ” “ but thi is my special hobbi , and the differ are equal obviou . there is as much differ to my eye between the lead bourgeoi type of a time articl and the slovenli print of an even half-penni paper as there could be between your negro and your esquimau . the detect of type is one of the most elementari branch of knowledg to the special expert in crime , though I confess that onc when I wa veri young I confus the leed mercuri with the western morn new . but a time leader is entir distinct , and these word could have been taken from noth els . As it wa done yesterday the strong probabl wa that we should find the word in yesterday ’ s issue. ” “ So far as I can follow you , then , mr. holm , ” said sir henri baskervil , “ someon cut out thi messag with a scissor -- ” “ nail-scissor , ” said holm . “ you can see that it wa a veri short-blad scissor , sinc the cutter had to take two snip over ‘ keep away. ’ ” “ that is so . someon , then , cut out the messag with a pair of short-blad scissor , past it with past -- ” “ gum , ” said holm . “ with gum on to the paper . but I want to know whi the word ‘ moor ’ should have been written ? ” “ becaus he could not find it in print . the other word were all simpl and might be found in ani issu , but ‘ moor ’ would be less common. ” “ whi , of cours , that would explain it . have you read anyth els in thi messag , mr. holm ? ” “ there are one or two indic , and yet the utmost pain have been taken to remov all clue . the address , you observ is print in rough charact . but the time is a paper which is seldom found in ani hand but those of the highli educ . We may take it , therefor , that the letter wa compos by an educ man who wish to pose as an uneduc one , and hi effort to conceal hi own write suggest that that write might be known , or come to be known , by you . again , you will observ that the word are not gum on in an accur line , but that some are much higher than other . ‘ life , ’ for exampl is quit out of it proper place . that may point to careless or it may point to agit and hurri upon the part of the cutter . On the whole I inclin to the latter view , sinc the matter wa evid import , and it is unlik that the compos of such a letter would be careless . If he were in a hurri it open up the interest question whi he should be in a hurri , sinc ani letter post up to earli morn would reach sir henri befor he would leav hi hotel . did the compos fear an interrupt -- and from whom ? ” “ We are come now rather into the region of guesswork , ” said dr. mortim . “ say , rather , into the region where we balanc probabl and choos the most like . It is the scientif use of the imagin , but we have alway some materi basi on which to start our specul . now , you would call it a guess , no doubt , but I am almost certain that thi address ha been written in a hotel. ” “ how in the world can you say that ? ” “ If you examin it care you will see that both the pen and the ink have given the writer troubl . the pen ha splutter twice in a singl word and ha run dri three time in a short address , show that there wa veri littl ink in the bottl . now , a privat pen or ink-bottl is seldom allow to be in such a state , and the combin of the two must be quit rare . but you know the hotel ink and the hotel pen , where it is rare to get anyth els . ye , I have veri littl hesit in say that could we examin the waste-pap basket of the hotel around chare cross until we found the remain of the mutil time leader we could lay our hand straight upon the person who sent thi singular messag . halloa ! halloa ! what ’ s thi ? ” He wa care examin the foolscap , upon which the word were past , hold it onli an inch or two from hi eye . “ well ? ” “ noth , ” said he , throw it down . “ It is a blank half-sheet of paper , without even a water-mark upon it . I think we have drawn as much as we can from thi curiou letter ; and now , sir henri , ha anyth els of interest happen to you sinc you have been in london ? ” “ whi , no , mr. holm . I think not. ” “ you have not observ anyon follow or watch you ? ” “ I seem to have walk right into the thick of a dime novel , ” said our visitor . “ whi in thunder should anyon follow or watch me ? ” “ We are come to that . you have noth els to report to us befor we go into thi matter ? ” “ well , it depend upon what you think worth reporting. ” “ I think anyth out of the ordinari routin of life well worth reporting. ” sir henri smile . “ I don ’ t know much of british life yet , for I have spent nearli all my time in the state and in canada . but I hope that to lose one of your boot is not part of the ordinari routin of life over here. ” “ you have lost one of your boot ? ” “ My dear sir , ” cri dr. mortim , “ it is onli mislaid . you will find it when you return to the hotel . what is the use of troubl mr. holm with trifl of thi kind ? ” “ well , he ask me for anyth outsid the ordinari routine. ” “ exactli , ” said holm , “ howev foolish the incid may seem . you have lost one of your boot , you say ? ” “ well , mislaid it , anyhow . I put them both outsid my door last night , and there wa onli one in the morn . I could get no sens out of the chap who clean them . the worst of it is that I onli bought the pair last night in the strand , and I have never had them on. ” “ If you have never worn them , whi did you put them out to be clean ? ” “ they were tan boot and had never been varnish . that wa whi I put them out. ” “ then I understand that on your arriv in london yesterday you went out at onc and bought a pair of boot ? ” “ I did a good deal of shop . dr. mortim here went round with me . you see , if I am to be squir down there I must dress the part , and it may be that I have got a littl careless in my way out west . among other thing I bought these brown boot -- gave six dollar for them -- and had one stolen befor ever I had them on my feet. ” “ It seem a singularli useless thing to steal , ” said sherlock holm . “ I confess that I share dr. mortim ’ s belief that it will not be long befor the miss boot is found. ” “ and , now , gentlemen , ” said the baronet with decis , “ it seem to me that I have spoken quit enough about the littl that I know . It is time that you kept your promis and gave me a full account of what we are all drive at. ” “ your request is a veri reason one , ” holm answer . “ Dr . mortim , I think you could not do better than to tell your stori as you told it to us. ” thu encourag , our scientif friend drew hi paper from hi pocket and present the whole case as he had done upon the morn befor . sir henri baskervil listen with the deepest attent and with an occasion exclam of surpris . “ well , I seem to have come into an inherit with a vengeanc , ” said he when the long narr wa finish . “ Of cours , I ’ ve heard of the hound ever sinc I wa in the nurseri . It ’ s the pet stori of the famili , though I never thought of take it serious befor . but as to my uncl ’ s death -- well , it all seem boil up in my head , and I can ’ t get it clear yet . you don ’ t seem quit to have made up your mind whether it ’ s a case for a policeman or a clergyman. ” “ precisely. ” “ and now there ’ s thi affair of the letter to me at the hotel . I suppos that fit into it place. ” “ It seem to show that someon know more than we do about what goe on upon the moor , ” said dr. mortim . “ and also , ” said holm , “ that someon is not ill-dispos toward you , sinc they warn you of danger. ” “ Or it may be that they wish , for their own purpos , to scare me away. ” “ well , of cours , that is possibl also . I am veri much indebt to you , dr. mortim , for introduc me to a problem which present sever interest altern . but the practic point which we now have to decid , sir henri , is whether it is or is not advis for you to go to baskervil hall. ” “ whi should I not go ? ” “ there seem to be danger. ” “ Do you mean danger from thi famili fiend or do you mean danger from human be ? ” “ well , that is what we have to find out. ” “ whichev it is , my answer is fix . there is no devil in hell , mr. holm , and there is no man upon earth who can prevent me from go to the home of my own peopl , and you may take that to be my final answer. ” hi dark brow knit and hi face flush to a duski red as he spoke . It wa evid that the fieri temper of the baskervil wa not extinct in thi their last repres . “ meanwhil , ” said he , “ I have hardli had time to think over all that you have told me . It ’ s a big thing for a man to have to understand and to decid at one sit . I should like to have a quiet hour by myself to make up my mind . now , look here , mr. holm , it ’ s half-past eleven now and I am go back right away to my hotel . suppos you and your friend , dr. watson , come round and lunch with us at two . I ’ ll be abl to tell you more clearli then how thi thing strike me. ” “ Is that conveni to you , watson ? ” “ perfectly. ” “ then you may expect us . shall I have a cab call ? ” “ I ’ d prefer to walk , for thi affair ha flurri me rather. ” “ I ’ ll join you in a walk , with pleasur , ” said hi companion . “ then we meet again at two o ’ clock . Au revoir , and good-morn ! ” We heard the step of our visitor descend the stair and the bang of the front door . In an instant holm had chang from the languid dreamer to the man of action . “ your hat and boot , watson , quick ! not a moment to lose ! ” He rush into hi room in hi dressing-gown and wa back again in a few second in a frock-coat . We hurri togeth down the stair and into the street . dr. mortim and baskervil were still visibl about two hundr yard ahead of us in the direct of oxford street . “ shall I run on and stop them ? ” “ not for the world , my dear watson . I am perfectli satisfi with your compani if you will toler mine . our friend are wise , for it is certainli a veri fine morn for a walk. ” He quicken hi pace until we had decreas the distanc which divid us by about half . then , still keep a hundr yard behind , we follow into oxford street and so down regent street . onc our friend stop and stare into a shop window , upon which holm did the same . An instant afterward he gave a littl cri of satisfact , and , follow the direct of hi eager eye , I saw that a hansom cab with a man insid which had halt on the other side of the street wa now proceed slowli onward again . “ there ’ s our man , watson ! come along ! We ’ ll have a good look at him , if we can do no more. ” At that instant I wa awar of a bushi black beard and a pair of pierc eye turn upon us through the side window of the cab . instantli the trapdoor at the top flew up , someth wa scream to the driver , and the cab flew madli off down regent street . holm look eagerli round for anoth , but no empti one wa in sight . then he dash in wild pursuit amid the stream of the traffic , but the start wa too great , and alreadi the cab wa out of sight . “ there now ! ” said holm bitterli as he emerg pant and white with vexat from the tide of vehicl . “ wa ever such bad luck and such bad manag , too ? watson , watson , if you are an honest man you will record thi also and set it against my success ! ” “ who wa the man ? ” “ I have not an idea. ” “ A spi ? ” “ well , it wa evid from what we have heard that baskervil ha been veri close shadow by someon sinc he ha been in town . how els could it be known so quickli that it wa the northumberland hotel which he had chosen ? If they had follow him the first day I argu that they would follow him also the second . you may have observ that I twice stroll over to the window while dr. mortim wa read hi legend. ” “ ye , I remember. ” “ I wa look out for loiter in the street , but I saw none . We are deal with a clever man , watson . thi matter cut veri deep , and though I have not final made up my mind whether it is a benevol or a malevol agenc which is in touch with us , I am consciou alway of power and design . when our friend left I at onc follow them in the hope of mark down their invis attend . So wili wa he that he had not trust himself upon foot , but he had avail himself of a cab so that he could loiter behind or dash past them and so escap their notic . hi method had the addit advantag that if they were to take a cab he wa all readi to follow them . It ha , howev , one obviou disadvantage. ” “ It put him in the power of the cabman. ” “ exactly. ” “ what a piti we did not get the number ! ” “ My dear watson , clumsi as I have been , you sure do not serious imagin that I neglect to get the number ? No . 2704 is our man . but that is no use to us for the moment. ” “ I fail to see how you could have done more. ” “ On observ the cab I should have instantli turn and walk in the other direct . I should then at my leisur have hire a second cab and follow the first at a respect distanc , or , better still , have driven to the northumberland hotel and wait there . when our unknown had follow baskervil home we should have had the opportun of play hi own game upon himself and see where he made for . As it is , by an indiscreet eager , which wa taken advantag of with extraordinari quick and energi by our oppon , we have betray ourselv and lost our man. ” We had been saunter slowli down regent street dure thi convers , and dr. mortim , with hi companion , had long vanish in front of us . “ there is no object in our follow them , ” said holm . “ the shadow ha depart and will not return . We must see what further card we have in our hand and play them with decis . could you swear to that man ’ s face within the cab ? ” “ I could swear onli to the beard. ” “ and so could I -- from which I gather that in all probabl it wa a fals one . A clever man upon so delic an errand ha no use for a beard save to conceal hi featur . come in here , watson ! ” He turn into one of the district messeng offic , where he wa warmli greet by the manag . “ Ah , wilson , I see you have not forgotten the littl case in which I had the good fortun to help you ? ” “ No , sir , inde I have not . you save my good name , and perhap my life. ” “ My dear fellow , you exagger . I have some recollect , wilson , that you had among your boy a lad name cartwright , who show some abil dure the investigation. ” “ ye , sir , he is still with us. ” “ could you ring him up ? -- thank you ! and I should be glad to have chang of thi five-pound note. ” A lad of fourteen , with a bright , keen face , had obey the summon of the manag . He stood now gaze with great rever at the famou detect . “ let me have the hotel directori , ” said holm . “ thank you ! now , cartwright , there are the name of twenty-thre hotel here , all in the immedi neighbourhood of chare cross . Do you see ? ” “ ye , sir. ” “ you will visit each of these in turn. ” “ ye , sir. ” “ you will begin in each case by give the outsid porter one shill . here are twenty-thre shillings. ” “ ye , sir. ” “ you will tell him that you want to see the waste-pap of yesterday . you will say that an import telegram ha miscarri and that you are look for it . you understand ? ” “ ye , sir. ” “ but what you are realli look for is the centr page of the time with some hole cut in it with scissor . here is a copi of the time . It is thi page . you could easili recogn it , could you not ? ” “ ye , sir. ” “ In each case the outsid porter will send for the hall porter , to whom also you will give a shill . here are twenty-thre shill . you will then learn in possibl twenti case out of the twenty-thre that the wast of the day befor ha been burn or remov . In the three other case you will be shown a heap of paper and you will look for thi page of the time among it . the odd are enorm against your find it . there are ten shill over in case of emerg . let me have a report by wire at baker street befor even . and now , watson , it onli remain for us to find out by wire the ident of the cabman , No . 2704 , and then we will drop into one of the bond street pictur galleri and fill in the time until we are due at the hotel. ” chapter 5 . three broken thread sherlock holm had , in a veri remark degre , the power of detach hi mind at will . for two hour the strang busi in which we had been involv appear to be forgotten , and he wa entir absorb in the pictur of the modern belgian master . He would talk of noth but art , of which he had the crudest idea , from our leav the galleri until we found ourselv at the northumberland hotel . “ sir henri baskervil is upstair expect you , ” said the clerk . “ He ask me to show you up at onc when you came. ” “ have you ani object to my look at your regist ? ” said holm . “ not in the least. ” the book show that two name had been ad after that of baskervil . one wa theophilu johnson and famili , of newcastl ; the other mrs. oldmor and maid , of high lodg , alton . “ sure that must be the same johnson whom I use to know , ” said holm to the porter . “ A lawyer , is he not , gray-head , and walk with a limp ? ” “ No , sir , thi is mr. johnson , the coal-own , a veri activ gentleman , not older than yourself. ” “ sure you are mistaken about hi trade ? ” “ No , sir ! he ha use thi hotel for mani year , and he is veri well known to us. ” “ Ah , that settl it . mrs. oldmor , too ; I seem to rememb the name . excus my curios , but often in call upon one friend one find another. ” “ she is an invalid ladi , sir . her husband wa onc mayor of gloucest . she alway come to us when she is in town. ” “ thank you ; I am afraid I can not claim her acquaint . We have establish a most import fact by these question , watson , ” he continu in a low voic as we went upstair togeth . “ We know now that the peopl who are so interest in our friend have not settl down in hi own hotel . that mean that while they are , as we have seen , veri anxiou to watch him , they are equal anxiou that he should not see them . now , thi is a most suggest fact. ” “ what doe it suggest ? ” “ It suggest -- halloa , my dear fellow , what on earth is the matter ? ” As we came round the top of the stair we had run up against sir henri baskervil himself . hi face wa flush with anger , and he held an old and dusti boot in one of hi hand . So furiou wa he that he wa hardli articul , and when he did speak it wa in a much broader and more western dialect than ani which we had heard from him in the morn . “ seem to me they are play me for a sucker in thi hotel , ” he cri . “ they ’ ll find they ’ ve start in to monkey with the wrong man unless they are care . By thunder , if that chap can ’ t find my miss boot there will be troubl . I can take a joke with the best , mr. holm , but they ’ ve got a bit over the mark thi time. ” “ still look for your boot ? ” “ ye , sir , and mean to find it. ” “ but , sure , you said that it wa a new brown boot ? ” “ So it wa , sir . and now it ’ s an old black one. ” “ what ! you don ’ t mean to say -- ? ” “ that ’ s just what I do mean to say . I onli had three pair in the world -- the new brown , the old black , and the patent leather , which I am wear . last night they took one of my brown one , and today they have sneak one of the black . well , have you got it ? speak out , man , and don ’ t stand stare ! ” An agit german waiter had appear upon the scene . “ No , sir ; I have made inquiri all over the hotel , but I can hear no word of it. ” “ well , either that boot come back befor sundown or I ’ ll see the manag and tell him that I go right straight out of thi hotel. ” “ It shall be found , sir -- I promis you that if you will have a littl patienc it will be found. ” “ mind it is , for it ’ s the last thing of mine that I ’ ll lose in thi den of thiev . well , well , mr. holm , you ’ ll excus my troubl you about such a trifl -- ” “ I think it ’ s well worth troubl about. ” “ whi , you look veri seriou over it. ” “ how do you explain it ? ” “ I just don ’ t attempt to explain it . It seem the veri maddest , queerest thing that ever happen to me. ” “ the queerest perhap -- ” said holm thought . “ what do you make of it yourself ? ” “ well , I don ’ t profess to understand it yet . thi case of your is veri complex , sir henri . when taken in conjunct with your uncl ’ s death I am not sure that of all the five hundr case of capit import which I have handl there is one which cut so deep . but we hold sever thread in our hand , and the odd are that one or other of them guid us to the truth . We may wast time in follow the wrong one , but sooner or later we must come upon the right. ” We had a pleasant luncheon in which littl wa said of the busi which had brought us togeth . It wa in the privat sitting-room to which we afterward repair that holm ask baskervil what were hi intent . “ To go to baskervil hall. ” “ and when ? ” “ At the end of the week. ” “ On the whole , ” said holm , “ I think that your decis is a wise one . I have ampl evid that you are be dog in london , and amid the million of thi great citi it is difficult to discov who these peopl are or what their object can be . If their intent are evil they might do you a mischief , and we should be powerless to prevent it . you did not know , dr. mortim , that you were follow thi morn from my hous ? ” dr. mortim start violent . “ follow ! By whom ? ” “ that , unfortun , is what I can not tell you . have you among your neighbour or acquaint on dartmoor ani man with a black , full beard ? ” “ No -- or , let me see -- whi , ye . barrymor , sir charl ’ s butler , is a man with a full , black beard. ” “ Ha ! where is barrymor ? ” “ He is in charg of the hall. ” “ We had best ascertain if he is realli there , or if by ani possibl he might be in london. ” “ how can you do that ? ” “ give me a telegraph form . ‘ Is all readi for sir henri ? ’ that will do . address to mr. barrymor , baskervil hall . what is the nearest telegraph-offic ? grimpen . veri good , we will send a second wire to the postmast , grimpen : ‘ telegram to mr. barrymor to be deliv into hi own hand . If absent , pleas return wire to sir henri baskervil , northumberland hotel. ’ that should let us know befor even whether barrymor is at hi post in devonshir or not. ” “ that ’ s so , ” said baskervil . “ By the way , dr. mortim , who is thi barrymor , anyhow ? ” “ He is the son of the old caretak , who is dead . they have look after the hall for four gener now . So far as I know , he and hi wife are as respect a coupl as ani in the county. ” “ At the same time , ” said baskervil , “ it ’ s clear enough that so long as there are none of the famili at the hall these peopl have a mighti fine home and noth to do. ” “ that is true. ” “ did barrymor profit at all by sir charl ’ s will ? ” ask holm . “ He and hi wife had five hundr pound each. ” “ Ha ! did they know that they would receiv thi ? ” “ ye ; sir charl wa veri fond of talk about the provis of hi will. ” “ that is veri interesting. ” “ I hope , ” said dr. mortim , “ that you do not look with suspici eye upon everyon who receiv a legaci from sir charl , for I also had a thousand pound left to me. ” “ inde ! and anyon els ? ” “ there were mani insignific sum to individu , and a larg number of public chariti . the residu all went to sir henry. ” “ and how much wa the residu ? ” “ seven hundr and forti thousand pounds. ” holm rais hi eyebrow in surpris . “ I had no idea that so gigant a sum wa involv , ” said he . “ sir charl had the reput of be rich , but we did not know how veri rich he wa until we came to examin hi secur . the total valu of the estat wa close on to a million. ” “ dear me ! It is a stake for which a man might well play a desper game . and one more question , dr. mortim . suppos that anyth happen to our young friend here -- you will forgiv the unpleas hypothesi ! -- who would inherit the estat ? ” “ sinc rodger baskervil , sir charl ’ s younger brother die unmarri , the estat would descend to the desmond , who are distant cousin . jame desmond is an elderli clergyman in westmoreland. ” “ thank you . these detail are all of great interest . have you met mr. jame desmond ? ” “ ye ; he onc came down to visit sir charl . He is a man of vener appear and of saintli life . I rememb that he refus to accept ani settlement from sir charl , though he press it upon him. ” “ and thi man of simpl tast would be the heir to sir charl ’ s thousands. ” “ He would be the heir to the estat becaus that is entail . He would also be the heir to the money unless it were will otherwis by the present owner , who can , of cours , do what he like with it. ” “ and have you made your will , sir henri ? ” “ No , mr. holm , I have not . I ’ ve had no time , for it wa onli yesterday that I learn how matter stood . but in ani case I feel that the money should go with the titl and estat . that wa my poor uncl ’ s idea . how is the owner go to restor the glori of the baskervil if he ha not money enough to keep up the properti ? hous , land , and dollar must go together. ” “ quit so . well , sir henri , I am of one mind with you as to the advis of your go down to devonshir without delay . there is onli one provis which I must make . you certainli must not go alone. ” “ Dr . mortim return with me. ” “ but dr. mortim ha hi practic to attend to , and hi hous is mile away from your . with all the goodwil in the world he may be unabl to help you . No , sir henri , you must take with you someon , a trusti man , who will be alway by your side. ” “ Is it possibl that you could come yourself , mr. holm ? ” “ If matter came to a crisi I should endeavour to be present in person ; but you can understand that , with my extens consult practic and with the constant appeal which reach me from mani quarter , it is imposs for me to be absent from london for an indefinit time . At the present instant one of the most rever name in england is be besmirch by a blackmail , and onli I can stop a disastr scandal . you will see how imposs it is for me to go to dartmoor. ” “ whom would you recommend , then ? ” holm laid hi hand upon my arm . “ If my friend would undertak it there is no man who is better worth have at your side when you are in a tight place . No one can say so more confid than I. ” the proposit took me complet by surpris , but befor I had time to answer , baskervil seiz me by the hand and wrung it heartili . “ well , now , that is real kind of you , dr. watson , ” said he . “ you see how it is with me , and you know just as much about the matter as I do . If you will come down to baskervil hall and see me through I ’ ll never forget it. ” the promis of adventur had alway a fascin for me , and I wa compliment by the word of holm and by the eager with which the baronet hail me as a companion . “ I will come , with pleasur , ” said I . “ I do not know how I could employ my time better. ” “ and you will report veri care to me , ” said holm . “ when a crisi come , as it will do , I will direct how you shall act . I suppos that by saturday all might be readi ? ” “ would that suit dr. watson ? ” “ perfectly. ” “ then on saturday , unless you hear to the contrari , we shall meet at the ten-thirti train from paddington. ” We had risen to depart when baskervil gave a cri , of triumph , and dive into one of the corner of the room he drew a brown boot from under a cabinet . “ My miss boot ! ” he cri . “ may all our difficulti vanish as easili ! ” said sherlock holm . “ but it is a veri singular thing , ” dr. mortim remark . “ I search thi room care befor lunch. ” “ and so did I , ” said baskervil . “ everi inch of it. ” “ there wa certainli no boot in it then. ” “ In that case the waiter must have place it there while we were lunching. ” the german wa sent for but profess to know noth of the matter , nor could ani inquiri clear it up . anoth item had been ad to that constant and appar purposeless seri of small mysteri which had succeed each other so rapidli . set asid the whole grim stori of sir charl ’ s death , we had a line of inexplic incid all within the limit of two day , which includ the receipt of the print letter , the black-beard spi in the hansom , the loss of the new brown boot , the loss of the old black boot , and now the return of the new brown boot . holm sat in silenc in the cab as we drove back to baker street , and I knew from hi drawn brow and keen face that hi mind , like my own , wa busi in endeavour to frame some scheme into which all these strang and appar disconnect episod could be fit . all afternoon and late into the even he sat lost in tobacco and thought . just befor dinner two telegram were hand in . the first ran : have just heard that barrymor is at the hall . baskervil . the second : visit twenty-thre hotel as direct , but sorri , to report unabl to trace cut sheet of time . cartwright . “ there go two of my thread , watson . there is noth more stimul than a case where everyth goe against you . We must cast round for anoth scent. ” “ We have still the cabman who drove the spy. ” “ exactli . I have wire to get hi name and address from the offici registri . I should not be surpris if thi were an answer to my question. ” the ring at the bell prove to be someth even more satisfactori than an answer , howev , for the door open and a rough-look fellow enter who wa evid the man himself . “ I got a messag from the head offic that a gent at thi address had been inquir for No . 2704 , ” said he . “ I ’ ve driven my cab thi seven year and never a word of complaint . I came here straight from the yard to ask you to your face what you had against me. ” “ I have noth in the world against you , my good man , ” said holm . “ On the contrari , I have half a sovereign for you if you will give me a clear answer to my questions. ” “ well , I ’ ve had a good day and no mistak , ” said the cabman with a grin . “ what wa it you want to ask , sir ? ” “ first of all your name and address , in case I want you again. ” “ john clayton , 3 turpey street , the borough . My cab is out of shipley ’ s yard , near waterloo station. ” sherlock holm made a note of it . “ now , clayton , tell me all about the fare who came and watch thi hous at ten o ’ clock thi morn and afterward follow the two gentlemen down regent street. ” the man look surpris and a littl embarrass . “ whi , there ’ s no good my tell you thing , for you seem to know as much as I do alreadi , ” said he . “ the truth is that the gentleman told me that he wa a detect and that I wa to say noth about him to anyone. ” “ My good fellow ; thi is a veri seriou busi , and you may find yourself in a pretti bad posit if you tri to hide anyth from me . you say that your fare told you that he wa a detect ? ” “ ye , he did. ” “ when did he say thi ? ” “ when he left me. ” “ did he say anyth more ? ” “ He mention hi name. ” holm cast a swift glanc of triumph at me . “ Oh , he mention hi name , did he ? that wa imprud . what wa the name that he mention ? ” “ hi name , ” said the cabman , “ wa mr. sherlock holmes. ” never have I seen my friend more complet taken aback than by the cabman ’ s repli . for an instant he sat in silent amaz . then he burst into a hearti laugh . “ A touch , watson -- an undeni touch ! ” said he . “ I feel a foil as quick and suppl as my own . He got home upon me veri prettili that time . So hi name wa sherlock holm , wa it ? ” “ ye , sir , that wa the gentleman ’ s name. ” “ excel ! tell me where you pick him up and all that occurred. ” “ He hail me at half-past nine in trafalgar squar . He said that he wa a detect , and he offer me two guinea if I would do exactli what he want all day and ask no question . I wa glad enough to agre . first we drove down to the northumberland hotel and wait there until two gentlemen came out and took a cab from the rank . We follow their cab until it pull up somewher near here. ” “ thi veri door , ” said holm . “ well , I couldn ’ t be sure of that , but I dare say my fare knew all about it . We pull up halfway down the street and wait an hour and a half . then the two gentlemen pass us , walk , and we follow down baker street and along -- ” “ I know , ” said holm . “ until we got three-quart down regent street . then my gentleman threw up the trap , and he cri that I should drive right away to waterloo station as hard as I could go . I whip up the mare and we were there under the ten minut . then he paid up hi two guinea , like a good one , and away he went into the station . onli just as he wa leav he turn round and he said : ‘ It might interest you to know that you have been drive mr. sherlock holmes. ’ that ’ s how I come to know the name. ” “ I see . and you saw no more of him ? ” “ not after he went into the station. ” “ and how would you describ mr. sherlock holm ? ” the cabman scratch hi head . “ well , he wasn ’ t altogeth such an easi gentleman to describ . I ’ d put him at forti year of age , and he wa of a middl height , two or three inch shorter than you , sir . He wa dress like a toff , and he had a black beard , cut squar at the end , and a pale face . I don ’ t know as I could say more than that. ” “ colour of hi eye ? ” “ No , I can ’ t say that. ” “ noth more that you can rememb ? ” “ No , sir ; nothing. ” “ well , then , here is your half-sovereign . there ’ s anoth one wait for you if you can bring ani more inform . good-night ! ” “ good-night , sir , and thank you ! ” john clayton depart chuckl , and holm turn to me with a shrug of hi shoulder and a rueful smile . “ snap goe our third thread , and we end where we began , ” said he . “ the cun rascal ! He knew our number , knew that sir henri baskervil had consult me , spot who I wa in regent street , conjectur that I had got the number of the cab and would lay my hand on the driver , and so sent back thi audaci messag . I tell you , watson , thi time we have got a foeman who is worthi of our steel . I ’ ve been checkmat in london . I can onli wish you better luck in devonshir . but I ’ m not easi in my mind about it. ” “ about what ? ” “ about send you . It ’ s an ugli busi , watson , an ugli danger busi , and the more I see of it the less I like it . ye , my dear fellow , you may laugh , but I give you my word that I shall be veri glad to have you back safe and sound in baker street onc more. ” chapter 6 . baskervil hall sir henri baskervil and dr. mortim were readi upon the appoint day , and we start as arrang for devonshir . mr. sherlock holm drove with me to the station and gave me hi last part injunct and advic . “ I will not bia your mind by suggest theori or suspicion , watson , ” said he ; “ I wish you simpli to report fact in the fullest possibl manner to me , and you can leav me to do the theorizing. ” “ what sort of fact ? ” I ask . “ anyth which may seem to have a bear howev indirect upon the case , and especi the relat between young baskervil and hi neighbour or ani fresh particular concern the death of sir charl . I have made some inquiri myself in the last few day , but the result have , I fear , been neg . one thing onli appear to be certain , and that is that mr. jame desmond , who is the next heir , is an elderli gentleman of a veri amiabl disposit , so that thi persecut doe not aris from him . I realli think that we may elimin him entir from our calcul . there remain the peopl who will actual surround sir henri baskervil upon the moor. ” “ would it not be well in the first place to get rid of thi barrymor coupl ? ” “ By no mean . you could not make a greater mistak . If they are innoc it would be a cruel injustic , and if they are guilti we should be give up all chanc of bring it home to them . No , no , we will preserv them upon our list of suspect . then there is a groom at the hall , if I rememb right . there are two moorland farmer . there is our friend dr. mortim , whom I believ to be entir honest , and there is hi wife , of whom we know noth . there is thi naturalist , stapleton , and there is hi sister , who is said to be a young ladi of attract . there is mr. frankland , of lafter hall , who is also an unknown factor , and there are one or two other neighbour . these are the folk who must be your veri special study. ” “ I will do my best. ” “ you have arm , I suppos ? ” “ ye , I thought it as well to take them. ” “ most certainli . keep your revolv near you night and day , and never relax your precautions. ” our friend had alreadi secur a first-class carriag and were wait for us upon the platform . “ No , we have no news of ani kind , ” said dr. mortim in answer to my friend ’ s question . “ I can swear to one thing , and that is that we have not been shadow dure the last two day . We have never gone out without keep a sharp watch , and no one could have escap our notice. ” “ you have alway kept togeth , I presum ? ” “ except yesterday afternoon . I usual give up one day to pure amus when I come to town , so I spent it at the museum of the colleg of surgeons. ” “ and I went to look at the folk in the park , ” said baskervil . “ but we had no troubl of ani kind. ” “ It wa imprud , all the same , ” said holm , shake hi head and look veri grave . “ I beg , sir henri , that you will not go about alon . some great misfortun will befal you if you do . did you get your other boot ? ” “ No , sir , it is gone forever. ” “ inde . that is veri interest . well , good-by , ” he ad as the train began to glide down the platform . “ bear in mind , sir henri , one of the phrase in that queer old legend which dr. mortim ha read to us , and avoid the moor in those hour of dark when the power of evil are exalted. ” I look back at the platform when we had left it far behind and saw the tall , auster figur of holm stand motionless and gaze after us . the journey wa a swift and pleasant one , and I spent it in make the more intim acquaint of my two companion and in play with dr. mortim ’ s spaniel . In a veri few hour the brown earth had becom ruddi , the brick had chang to granit , and red cow graze in well-hedg field where the lush grass and more luxuri veget spoke of a richer , if a damper , climat . young baskervil stare eagerli out of the window and cri aloud with delight as he recogn the familiar featur of the devon sceneri . “ I ’ ve been over a good part of the world sinc I left it , dr. watson , ” said he ; “ but I have never seen a place to compar with it. ” “ I never saw a devonshir man who did not swear by hi counti , ” I remark . “ It depend upon the breed of men quit as much as on the counti , ” said dr. mortim . “ A glanc at our friend here reveal the round head of the celt , which carri insid it the celtic enthusiasm and power of attach . poor sir charl ’ s head wa of a veri rare type , half gaelic , half ivernian in it characterist . but you were veri young when you last saw baskervil hall , were you not ? ” “ I wa a boy in my teen at the time of my father ’ s death and had never seen the hall , for he live in a littl cottag on the south coast . thenc I went straight to a friend in america . I tell you it is all as new to me as it is to dr. watson , and I ’ m as keen as possibl to see the moor. ” “ are you ? then your wish is easili grant , for there is your first sight of the moor , ” said dr. mortim , point out of the carriag window . over the green squar of the field and the low curv of a wood there rose in the distanc a gray , melancholi hill , with a strang jag summit , dim and vagu in the distanc , like some fantast landscap in a dream . baskervil sat for a long time , hi eye fix upon it , and I read upon hi eager face how much it meant to him , thi first sight of that strang spot where the men of hi blood had held sway so long and left their mark so deep . there he sat , with hi tweed suit and hi american accent , in the corner of a prosaic railway-carriag , and yet as I look at hi dark and express face I felt more than ever how true a descend he wa of that long line of high-blood , fieri , and master men . there were pride , valour , and strength in hi thick brow , hi sensit nostril , and hi larg hazel eye . If on that forbid moor a difficult and danger quest should lie befor us , thi wa at least a comrad for whom one might ventur to take a risk with the certainti that he would brave share it . the train pull up at a small waysid station and we all descend . outsid , beyond the low , white fenc , a wagonett with a pair of cob wa wait . our come wa evid a great event , for station-mast and porter cluster round us to carri out our luggag . It wa a sweet , simpl countri spot , but I wa surpris to observ that by the gate there stood two soldierli men in dark uniform who lean upon their short rifl and glanc keenli at us as we pass . the coachman , a hard-fac , gnarl littl fellow , salut sir henri baskervil , and in a few minut we were fli swiftli down the broad , white road . roll pastur land curv upward on either side of us , and old gabl hous peep out from amid the thick green foliag , but behind the peac and sunlit countrysid there rose ever , dark against the even sky , the long , gloomi curv of the moor , broken by the jag and sinist hill . the wagonett swung round into a side road , and we curv upward through deep lane worn by centuri of wheel , high bank on either side , heavi with drip moss and fleshi hart ’ s-tongu fern . bronz bracken and mottl brambl gleam in the light of the sink sun . still steadili rise , we pass over a narrow granit bridg and skirt a noisi stream which gush swiftli down , foam and roar amid the gray boulder . both road and stream wound up through a valley dens with scrub oak and fir . At everi turn baskervil gave an exclam of delight , look eagerli about him and ask countless question . To hi eye all seem beauti , but to me a ting of melancholi lay upon the countrysid , which bore so clearli the mark of the wane year . yellow leav carpet the lane and flutter down upon us as we pass . the rattl of our wheel die away as we drove through drift of rot veget -- sad gift , as it seem to me , for natur to throw befor the carriag of the return heir of the baskervil . “ halloa ! ” cri dr. mortim , “ what is thi ? ” A steep curv of heath-clad land , an outli spur of the moor , lay in front of us . On the summit , hard and clear like an equestrian statu upon it pedest , wa a mount soldier , dark and stern , hi rifl pois readi over hi forearm . He wa watch the road along which we travel . “ what is thi , perkin ? ” ask dr. mortim . our driver half turn in hi seat . “ there ’ s a convict escap from princetown , sir . He ’ s been out three day now , and the warder watch everi road and everi station , but they ’ ve had no sight of him yet . the farmer about here don ’ t like it , sir , and that ’ s a fact. ” “ well , I understand that they get five pound if they can give information. ” “ ye , sir , but the chanc of five pound is but a poor thing compar to the chanc of have your throat cut . you see , it isn ’ t like ani ordinari convict . thi is a man that would stick at nothing. ” “ who is he , then ? ” “ It is selden , the not hill murderer. ” I rememb the case well , for it wa one in which holm had taken an interest on account of the peculiar feroc of the crime and the wanton brutal which had mark all the action of the assassin . the commut of hi death sentenc had been due to some doubt as to hi complet saniti , so atroci wa hi conduct . our wagonett had top a rise and in front of us rose the huge expans of the moor , mottl with gnarl and craggi cairn and tor . A cold wind swept down from it and set us shiver . somewher there , on that desol plain , wa lurk thi fiendish man , hide in a burrow like a wild beast , hi heart full of malign against the whole race which had cast him out . It need but thi to complet the grim suggest of the barren wast , the chill wind , and the darkl sky . even baskervil fell silent and pull hi overcoat more close around him . We had left the fertil countri behind and beneath us . We look back on it now , the slant ray of a low sun turn the stream to thread of gold and glow on the red earth new turn by the plough and the broad tangl of the woodland . the road in front of us grew bleaker and wilder over huge russet and oliv slope , sprinkl with giant boulder . now and then we pass a moorland cottag , wall and roof with stone , with no creeper to break it harsh outlin . suddenli we look down into a cuplik depress , patch with stunt oak and fir which had been twist and bent by the furi of year of storm . two high , narrow tower rose over the tree . the driver point with hi whip . “ baskervil hall , ” said he . it master had risen and wa stare with flush cheek and shine eye . A few minut later we had reach the lodge-g , a maze of fantast traceri in wrought iron , with weather-bitten pillar on either side , blotch with lichen , and surmount by the boar ’ head of the baskervil . the lodg wa a ruin of black granit and bare rib of rafter , but face it wa a new build , half construct , the first fruit of sir charl ’ s south african gold . through the gateway we pass into the avenu , where the wheel were again hush amid the leav , and the old tree shot their branch in a sombr tunnel over our head . baskervil shudder as he look up the long , dark drive to where the hous glimmer like a ghost at the farther end . “ wa it here ? ” he ask in a low voic . “ No , no , the yew alley is on the other side. ” the young heir glanc round with a gloomi face . “ It ’ s no wonder my uncl felt as if troubl were come on him in such a place as thi , ” said he . “ It ’ s enough to scare ani man . I ’ ll have a row of electr lamp up here insid of six month , and you won ’ t know it again , with a thousand candle-pow swan and edison right here in front of the hall door. ” the avenu open into a broad expans of turf , and the hous lay befor us . In the fade light I could see that the centr wa a heavi block of build from which a porch project . the whole front wa drape in ivi , with a patch clip bare here and there where a window or a coat of arm broke through the dark veil . from thi central block rose the twin tower , ancient , crenel , and pierc with mani loophol . To right and left of the turret were more modern wing of black granit . A dull light shone through heavi mullion window , and from the high chimney which rose from the steep , high-angl roof there sprang a singl black column of smoke . “ welcom , sir henri ! welcom to baskervil hall ! ” A tall man had step from the shadow of the porch to open the door of the wagonett . the figur of a woman wa silhouet against the yellow light of the hall . she came out and help the man to hand down our bag . “ you don ’ t mind my drive straight home , sir henri ? ” said dr. mortim . “ My wife is expect me. ” “ sure you will stay and have some dinner ? ” “ No , I must go . I shall probabl find some work await me . I would stay to show you over the hous , but barrymor will be a better guid than I. good-by , and never hesit night or day to send for me if I can be of service. ” the wheel die away down the drive while sir henri and I turn into the hall , and the door clang heavili behind us . It wa a fine apart in which we found ourselv , larg , lofti , and heavili rafter with huge baulk of age-blacken oak . In the great old-fashion fireplac behind the high iron dog a log-fir crackl and snap . sir henri and I held out our hand to it , for we were numb from our long drive . then we gaze round us at the high , thin window of old stain glass , the oak panel , the stag ’ head , the coat of arm upon the wall , all dim and sombr in the subdu light of the central lamp . “ It ’ s just as I imagin it , ” said sir henri . “ Is it not the veri pictur of an old famili home ? To think that thi should be the same hall in which for five hundr year my peopl have live . It strike me solemn to think of it. ” I saw hi dark face lit up with a boyish enthusiasm as he gaze about him . the light beat upon him where he stood , but long shadow trail down the wall and hung like a black canopi abov him . barrymor had return from take our luggag to our room . He stood in front of us now with the subdu manner of a well-train servant . He wa a remarkable-look man , tall , handsom , with a squar black beard and pale , distinguish featur . “ would you wish dinner to be serv at onc , sir ? ” “ Is it readi ? ” “ In a veri few minut , sir . you will find hot water in your room . My wife and I will be happi , sir henri , to stay with you until you have made your fresh arrang , but you will understand that under the new condit thi hous will requir a consider staff. ” “ what new condit ? ” “ I onli meant , sir , that sir charl led a veri retir life , and we were abl to look after hi want . you would , natur , wish to have more compani , and so you will need chang in your household. ” “ Do you mean that your wife and you wish to leav ? ” “ onli when it is quit conveni to you , sir. ” “ but your famili have been with us for sever gener , have they not ? I should be sorri to begin my life here by break an old famili connection. ” I seem to discern some sign of emot upon the butler ’ s white face . “ I feel that also , sir , and so doe my wife . but to tell the truth , sir , we were both veri much attach to sir charl , and hi death gave us a shock and made these surround veri pain to us . I fear that we shall never again be easi in our mind at baskervil hall. ” “ but what do you intend to do ? ” “ I have no doubt , sir , that we shall succeed in establish ourselv in some busi . sir charl ’ s generos ha given us the mean to do so . and now , sir , perhap I had best show you to your rooms. ” A squar balustrad galleri ran round the top of the old hall , approach by a doubl stair . from thi central point two long corridor extend the whole length of the build , from which all the bedroom open . My own wa in the same wing as baskervil ’ s and almost next door to it . these room appear to be much more modern than the central part of the hous , and the bright paper and numer candl did someth to remov the sombr impress which our arriv had left upon my mind . but the dining-room which open out of the hall wa a place of shadow and gloom . It wa a long chamber with a step separ the dai where the famili sat from the lower portion reserv for their depend . At one end a minstrel ’ s galleri overlook it . black beam shot across abov our head , with a smoke-darken ceil beyond them . with row of flare torch to light it up , and the colour and rude hilar of an old-tim banquet , it might have soften ; but now , when two black-cloth gentlemen sat in the littl circl of light thrown by a shade lamp , one ’ s voic becam hush and one ’ s spirit subdu . A dim line of ancestor , in everi varieti of dress , from the elizabethan knight to the buck of the regenc , stare down upon us and daunt us by their silent compani . We talk littl , and I for one wa glad when the meal wa over and we were abl to retir into the modern billiard-room and smoke a cigarett . “ My word , it isn ’ t a veri cheer place , ” said sir henri . “ I suppos one can tone down to it , but I feel a bit out of the pictur at present . I don ’ t wonder that my uncl got a littl jumpi if he live all alon in such a hous as thi . howev , if it suit you , we will retir earli tonight , and perhap thing may seem more cheer in the morning. ” I drew asid my curtain befor I went to bed and look out from my window . It open upon the grassi space which lay in front of the hall door . beyond , two cops of tree moan and swung in a rise wind . A half moon broke through the rift of race cloud . In it cold light I saw beyond the tree a broken fring of rock , and the long , low curv of the melancholi moor . I close the curtain , feel that my last impress wa in keep with the rest . and yet it wa not quit the last . I found myself weari and yet wake , toss restlessli from side to side , seek for the sleep which would not come . far away a chime clock struck out the quarter of the hour , but otherwis a deathli silenc lay upon the old hous . and then suddenli , in the veri dead of the night , there came a sound to my ear , clear , reson , and unmistak . It wa the sob of a woman , the muffl , strangl gasp of one who is torn by an uncontrol sorrow . I sat up in bed and listen intent . the nois could not have been far away and wa certainli in the hous . for half an hour I wait with everi nerv on the alert , but there came no other sound save the chime clock and the rustl of the ivi on the wall . chapter 7 . the stapleton of merripit hous the fresh beauti of the follow morn did someth to effac from our mind the grim and gray impress which had been left upon both of us by our first experi of baskervil hall . As sir henri and I sat at breakfast the sunlight flood in through the high mullion window , throw wateri patch of colour from the coat of arm which cover them . the dark panel glow like bronz in the golden ray , and it wa hard to realiz that thi wa inde the chamber which had struck such a gloom into our soul upon the even befor . “ I guess it is ourselv and not the hous that we have to blame ! ” said the baronet . “ We were tire with our journey and chill by our drive , so we took a gray view of the place . now we are fresh and well , so it is all cheer onc more. ” “ and yet it wa not entir a question of imagin , ” I answer . “ did you , for exampl , happen to hear someon , a woman I think , sob in the night ? ” “ that is curiou , for I did when I wa half asleep fanci that I heard someth of the sort . I wait quit a time , but there wa no more of it , so I conclud that it wa all a dream. ” “ I heard it distinctli , and I am sure that it wa realli the sob of a woman. ” “ We must ask about thi right away. ” He rang the bell and ask barrymor whether he could account for our experi . It seem to me that the pallid featur of the butler turn a shade paler still as he listen to hi master ’ s question . “ there are onli two women in the hous , sir henri , ” he answer . “ one is the scullery-maid , who sleep in the other wing . the other is my wife , and I can answer for it that the sound could not have come from her. ” and yet he lie as he said it , for it chanc that after breakfast I met mrs. barrymor in the long corridor with the sun full upon her face . she wa a larg , impass , heavy-featur woman with a stern set express of mouth . but her telltal eye were red and glanc at me from between swollen lid . It wa she , then , who wept in the night , and if she did so her husband must know it . yet he had taken the obviou risk of discoveri in declar that it wa not so . whi had he done thi ? and whi did she weep so bitterli ? alreadi round thi pale-fac , handsom , black-beard man there wa gather an atmospher of mysteri and of gloom . It wa he who had been the first to discov the bodi of sir charl , and we had onli hi word for all the circumst which led up to the old man ’ s death . wa it possibl that it wa barrymor , after all , whom we had seen in the cab in regent street ? the beard might well have been the same . the cabman had describ a somewhat shorter man , but such an impress might easili have been erron . how could I settl the point forev ? obvious the first thing to do wa to see the grimpen postmast and find whether the test telegram had realli been place in barrymor ’ s own hand . Be the answer what it might , I should at least have someth to report to sherlock holm . sir henri had numer paper to examin after breakfast , so that the time wa propiti for my excurs . It wa a pleasant walk of four mile along the edg of the moor , lead me at last to a small gray hamlet , in which two larger build , which prove to be the inn and the hous of dr. mortim , stood high abov the rest . the postmast , who wa also the villag grocer , had a clear recollect of the telegram . “ certainli , sir , ” said he , “ I had the telegram deliv to mr. barrymor exactli as directed. ” “ who deliv it ? ” “ My boy here . jame , you deliv that telegram to mr. barrymor at the hall last week , did you not ? ” “ ye , father , I deliv it. ” “ into hi own hand ? ” I ask . “ well , he wa up in the loft at the time , so that I could not put it into hi own hand , but I gave it into mrs. barrymor ’ s hand , and she promis to deliv it at once. ” “ did you see mr. barrymor ? ” “ No , sir ; I tell you he wa in the loft. ” “ If you didn ’ t see him , how do you know he wa in the loft ? ” “ well , sure hi own wife ought to know where he is , ” said the postmast testili . “ didn ’ t he get the telegram ? If there is ani mistak it is for mr. barrymor himself to complain. ” It seem hopeless to pursu the inquiri ani farther , but it wa clear that in spite of holm ’ s ruse we had no proof that barrymor had not been in london all the time . suppos that it were so -- suppos that the same man had been the last who had seen sir charl aliv , and the first to dog the new heir when he return to england . what then ? wa he the agent of other or had he some sinist design of hi own ? what interest could he have in persecut the baskervil famili ? I thought of the strang warn clip out of the lead articl of the time . wa that hi work or wa it possibl the do of someon who wa bent upon counteract hi scheme ? the onli conceiv motiv wa that which had been suggest by sir henri , that if the famili could be scare away a comfort and perman home would be secur for the barrymor . but sure such an explan as that would be quit inadequ to account for the deep and subtl scheme which seem to be weav an invis net round the young baronet . holm himself had said that no more complex case had come to him in all the long seri of hi sensat investig . I pray , as I walk back along the gray , lone road , that my friend might soon be freed from hi preoccup and abl to come down to take thi heavi burden of respons from my shoulder . suddenli my thought were interrupt by the sound of run feet behind me and by a voic which call me by name . I turn , expect to see dr. mortim , but to my surpris it wa a stranger who wa pursu me . He wa a small , slim , clean-shaven , prim-fac man , flaxen-hair and leanjaw , between thirti and forti year of age , dress in a gray suit and wear a straw hat . A tin box for botan specimen hung over hi shoulder and he carri a green butterfly-net in one of hi hand . “ you will , I am sure , excus my presumpt , dr. watson , ” said he as he came pant up to where I stood . “ here on the moor we are home folk and do not wait for formal introduct . you may possibl have heard my name from our mutual friend , mortim . I am stapleton , of merripit house. ” “ your net and box would have told me as much , ” said I , “ for I knew that mr. stapleton wa a naturalist . but how did you know me ? ” “ I have been call on mortim , and he point you out to me from the window of hi surgeri as you pass . As our road lay the same way I thought that I would overtak you and introduc myself . I trust that sir henri is none the wors for hi journey ? ” “ He is veri well , thank you. ” “ We were all rather afraid that after the sad death of sir charl the new baronet might refus to live here . It is ask much of a wealthi man to come down and buri himself in a place of thi kind , but I need not tell you that it mean a veri great deal to the countrysid . sir henri ha , I suppos , no superstiti fear in the matter ? ” “ I do not think that it is likely. ” “ Of cours you know the legend of the fiend dog which haunt the famili ? ” “ I have heard it. ” “ It is extraordinari how credul the peasant are about here ! ani number of them are readi to swear that they have seen such a creatur upon the moor. ” He spoke with a smile , but I seem to read in hi eye that he took the matter more serious . “ the stori took a great hold upon the imagin of sir charl , and I have no doubt that it led to hi tragic end. ” “ but how ? ” “ hi nerv were so work up that the appear of ani dog might have had a fatal effect upon hi diseas heart . I fanci that he realli did see someth of the kind upon that last night in the yew alley . I fear that some disast might occur , for I wa veri fond of the old man , and I knew that hi heart wa weak. ” “ how did you know that ? ” “ My friend mortim told me. ” “ you think , then , that some dog pursu sir charl , and that he die of fright in consequ ? ” “ have you ani better explan ? ” “ I have not come to ani conclusion. ” “ ha mr. sherlock holm ? ” the word took away my breath for an instant but a glanc at the placid face and steadfast eye of my companion show that no surpris wa intend . “ It is useless for us to pretend that we do not know you , dr. watson , ” said he . “ the record of your detect have reach us here , and you could not celebr him without be known yourself . when mortim told me your name he could not deni your ident . If you are here , then it follow that mr. sherlock holm is interest himself in the matter , and I am natur curiou to know what view he may take. ” “ I am afraid that I can not answer that question. ” “ may I ask if he is go to honour us with a visit himself ? ” “ He can not leav town at present . He ha other case which engag hi attention. ” “ what a piti ! He might throw some light on that which is so dark to us . but as to your own research , if there is ani possibl way in which I can be of servic to you I trust that you will command me . If I had ani indic of the natur of your suspicion or how you propos to investig the case , I might perhap even now give you some aid or advice. ” “ I assur you that I am simpli here upon a visit to my friend , sir henri , and that I need no help of ani kind. ” “ excel ! ” said stapleton . “ you are perfectli right to be wari and discreet . I am justli reprov for what I feel wa an unjustifi intrus , and I promis you that I will not mention the matter again. ” We had come to a point where a narrow grassi path struck off from the road and wound away across the moor . A steep , boulder-sprinkl hill lay upon the right which had in bygon day been cut into a granit quarri . the face which wa turn toward us form a dark cliff , with fern and brambl grow in it nich . from over a distant rise there float a gray plume of smoke . “ A moder walk along thi moor-path bring us to merripit hous , ” said he . “ perhap you will spare an hour that I may have the pleasur of introduc you to my sister. ” My first thought wa that I should be by sir henri ’ s side . but then I rememb the pile of paper and bill with which hi studi tabl wa litter . It wa certain that I could not help with those . and holm had expressli said that I should studi the neighbour upon the moor . I accept stapleton ’ s invit , and we turn togeth down the path . “ It is a wonder place , the moor , ” said he , look round over the undul down , long green roller , with crest of jag granit foam up into fantast surg . “ you never tire of the moor . you can not think the wonder secret which it contain . It is so vast , and so barren , and so mysterious. ” “ you know it well , then ? ” “ I have onli been here two year . the resid would call me a newcom . We came shortli after sir charl settl . but my tast led me to explor everi part of the countri round , and I should think that there are few men who know it better than I do. ” “ Is it hard to know ? ” “ veri hard . you see , for exampl , thi great plain to the north here with the queer hill break out of it . Do you observ anyth remark about that ? ” “ It would be a rare place for a gallop. ” “ you would natur think so and the thought ha cost sever their live befor now . you notic those bright green spot scatter thickli over it ? ” “ ye , they seem more fertil than the rest. ” stapleton laugh . “ that is the great grimpen mire , ” said he . “ A fals step yonder mean death to man or beast . onli yesterday I saw one of the moor poni wander into it . He never came out . I saw hi head for quit a long time crane out of the bog-hol , but it suck him down at last . even in dri season it is a danger to cross it , but after these autumn rain it is an aw place . and yet I can find my way to the veri heart of it and return aliv . By georg , there is anoth of those miser poni ! ” someth brown wa roll and toss among the green sedg . then a long , agon , writh neck shot upward and a dread cri echo over the moor . It turn me cold with horror , but my companion ’ s nerv seem to be stronger than mine . “ It ’ s gone ! ” said he . “ the mire ha him . two in two day , and mani more , perhap , for they get in the way of go there in the dri weather and never know the differ until the mire ha them in it clutch . It ’ s a bad place , the great grimpen mire. ” “ and you say you can penetr it ? ” “ ye , there are one or two path which a veri activ man can take . I have found them out. ” “ but whi should you wish to go into so horribl a place ? ” “ well , you see the hill beyond ? they are realli island cut off on all side by the impass mire , which ha crawl round them in the cours of year . that is where the rare plant and the butterfli are , if you have the wit to reach them. ” “ I shall tri my luck some day. ” He look at me with a surpris face . “ for god ’ s sake put such an idea out of your mind , ” said he . “ your blood would be upon my head . I assur you that there would not be the least chanc of your come back aliv . It is onli by rememb certain complex landmark that I am abl to do it. ” “ halloa ! ” I cri . “ what is that ? ” A long , low moan , indescrib sad , swept over the moor . It fill the whole air , and yet it wa imposs to say whenc it came . from a dull murmur it swell into a deep roar , and then sank back into a melancholi , throb murmur onc again . stapleton look at me with a curiou express in hi face . “ queer place , the moor ! ” said he . “ but what is it ? ” “ the peasant say it is the hound of the baskervil call for it prey . I ’ ve heard it onc or twice befor , but never quit so loud. ” I look round , with a chill of fear in my heart , at the huge swell plain , mottl with the green patch of rush . noth stir over the vast expans save a pair of raven , which croak loudli from a tor behind us . “ you are an educ man . you don ’ t believ such nonsens as that ? ” said I . “ what do you think is the caus of so strang a sound ? ” “ bog make queer nois sometim . It ’ s the mud settl , or the water rise , or something. ” “ No , no , that wa a live voice. ” “ well , perhap it wa . did you ever hear a bittern boom ? ” “ No , I never did. ” “ It ’ s a veri rare bird -- practic extinct -- in england now , but all thing are possibl upon the moor . ye , I should not be surpris to learn that what we have heard is the cri of the last of the bitterns. ” “ It ’ s the weirdest , strangest thing that ever I heard in my life. ” “ ye , it ’ s rather an uncanni place altogeth . look at the hillsid yonder . what do you make of those ? ” the whole steep slope wa cover with gray circular ring of stone , a score of them at least . “ what are they ? sheep-pen ? ” “ No , they are the home of our worthi ancestor . prehistor man live thickli on the moor , and as no one in particular ha live there sinc , we find all hi littl arrang exactli as he left them . these are hi wigwam with the roof off . you can even see hi hearth and hi couch if you have the curios to go insid . “ but it is quit a town . when wa it inhabit ? ” “ neolith man -- no date. ” “ what did he do ? ” “ He graze hi cattl on these slope , and he learn to dig for tin when the bronz sword began to supersed the stone axe . look at the great trench in the opposit hill . that is hi mark . ye , you will find some veri singular point about the moor , dr. watson . Oh , excus me an instant ! It is sure cyclopides. ” A small fli or moth had flutter across our path , and in an instant stapleton wa rush with extraordinari energi and speed in pursuit of it . To my dismay the creatur flew straight for the great mire , and my acquaint never paus for an instant , bound from tuft to tuft behind it , hi green net wave in the air . hi gray cloth and jerki , zigzag , irregular progress made him not unlik some huge moth himself . I wa stand watch hi pursuit with a mixtur of admir for hi extraordinari activ and fear lest he should lose hi foot in the treacher mire , when I heard the sound of step and , turn round , found a woman near me upon the path . she had come from the direct in which the plume of smoke indic the posit of merripit hous , but the dip of the moor had hid her until she wa quit close . I could not doubt that thi wa the miss stapleton of whom I had been told , sinc ladi of ani sort must be few upon the moor , and I rememb that I had heard someon describ her as be a beauti . the woman who approach me wa certainli that , and of a most uncommon type . there could not have been a greater contrast between brother and sister , for stapleton wa neutral tint , with light hair and gray eye , while she wa darker than ani brunett whom I have seen in england -- slim , eleg , and tall . she had a proud , fine cut face , so regular that it might have seem impass were it not for the sensit mouth and the beauti dark , eager eye . with her perfect figur and eleg dress she wa , inde , a strang apparit upon a lone moorland path . her eye were on her brother as I turn , and then she quicken her pace toward me . I had rais my hat and wa about to make some explanatori remark when her own word turn all my thought into a new channel . “ Go back ! ” she said . “ Go straight back to london , instantly. ” I could onli stare at her in stupid surpris . her eye blaze at me , and she tap the ground impati with her foot . “ whi should I go back ? ” I ask . “ I can not explain. ” she spoke in a low , eager voic , with a curiou lisp in her utter . “ but for god ’ s sake do what I ask you . Go back and never set foot upon the moor again. ” “ but I have onli just come. ” “ man , man ! ” she cri . “ can you not tell when a warn is for your own good ? Go back to london ! start tonight ! get away from thi place at all cost ! hush , my brother is come ! not a word of what I have said . would you mind get that orchid for me among the mare ’ s-tail yonder ? We are veri rich in orchid on the moor , though , of cours , you are rather late to see the beauti of the place. ” stapleton had abandon the chase and came back to us breath hard and flush with hi exert . “ halloa , beryl ! ” said he , and it seem to me that the tone of hi greet wa not altogeth a cordial one . “ well , jack , you are veri hot. ” “ ye , I wa chase a cyclopid . He is veri rare and seldom found in the late autumn . what a piti that I should have miss him ! ” He spoke unconcernedli , but hi small light eye glanc incessantli from the girl to me . “ you have introduc yourselv , I can see. ” “ ye . I wa tell sir henri that it wa rather late for him to see the true beauti of the moor. ” “ whi , who do you think thi is ? ” “ I imagin that it must be sir henri baskerville. ” “ No , no , ” said I . “ onli a humbl common , but hi friend . My name is dr. watson. ” A flush of vexat pass over her express face . “ We have been talk at cross purpos , ” said she . “ whi , you had not veri much time for talk , ” her brother remark with the same question eye . “ I talk as if dr. watson were a resid instead of be mere a visitor , ” said she . “ It can not much matter to him whether it is earli or late for the orchid . but you will come on , will you not , and see merripit hous ? ” A short walk brought us to it , a bleak moorland hous , onc the farm of some grazier in the old prosper day , but now put into repair and turn into a modern dwell . An orchard surround it , but the tree , as is usual upon the moor , were stunt and nip , and the effect of the whole place wa mean and melancholi . We were admit by a strang , wizen , rusty-co old manserv , who seem in keep with the hous . insid , howev , there were larg room furnish with an eleg in which I seem to recogn the tast of the ladi . As I look from their window at the intermin granite-fleck moor roll unbroken to the farthest horizon I could not but marvel at what could have brought thi highli educ man and thi beauti woman to live in such a place . “ queer spot to choos , is it not ? ” said he as if in answer to my thought . “ and yet we manag to make ourselv fairli happi , do we not , beryl ? ” “ quit happi , ” said she , but there wa no ring of convict in her word . “ I had a school , ” said stapleton . “ It wa in the north countri . the work to a man of my tempera wa mechan and uninterest , but the privileg of live with youth , of help to mould those young mind , and of impress them with one ’ s own charact and ideal wa veri dear to me . howev , the fate were against us . A seriou epidem broke out in the school and three of the boy die . It never recov from the blow , and much of my capit wa irretriev swallow up . and yet , if it were not for the loss of the charm companionship of the boy , I could rejoic over my own misfortun , for , with my strong tast for botani and zoolog , I find an unlimit field of work here , and my sister is as devot to natur as I am . all thi , dr. watson , ha been brought upon your head by your express as you survey the moor out of our window. ” “ It certainli did cross my mind that it might be a littl dull -- less for you , perhap , than for your sister. ” “ No , no , I am never dull , ” said she quickli . “ We have book , we have our studi , and we have interest neighbour . dr. mortim is a most learn man in hi own line . poor sir charl wa also an admir companion . We knew him well and miss him more than I can tell . Do you think that I should intrud if I were to call thi afternoon and make the acquaint of sir henri ? ” “ I am sure that he would be delighted. ” “ then perhap you would mention that I propos to do so . We may in our humbl way do someth to make thing more easi for him until he becom accustom to hi new surround . will you come upstair , dr. watson , and inspect my collect of lepidoptera ? I think it is the most complet one in the south-west of england . By the time that you have look through them lunch will be almost ready. ” but I wa eager to get back to my charg . the melancholi of the moor , the death of the unfortun poni , the weird sound which had been associ with the grim legend of the baskervil , all these thing ting my thought with sad . then on the top of these more or less vagu impress there had come the definit and distinct warn of miss stapleton , deliv with such intens earnest that I could not doubt that some grave and deep reason lay behind it . I resist all pressur to stay for lunch , and I set off at onc upon my return journey , take the grass-grown path by which we had come . It seem , howev , that there must have been some short cut for those who knew it , for befor I had reach the road I wa astound to see miss stapleton sit upon a rock by the side of the track . her face wa beauti flush with her exert and she held her hand to her side . “ I have run all the way in order to cut you off , dr. watson , ” said she . “ I had not even time to put on my hat . I must not stop , or my brother may miss me . I want to say to you how sorri I am about the stupid mistak I made in think that you were sir henri . pleas forget the word I said , which have no applic whatev to you. ” “ but I can ’ t forget them , miss stapleton , ” said I . “ I am sir henri ’ s friend , and hi welfar is a veri close concern of mine . tell me whi it wa that you were so eager that sir henri should return to london. ” “ A woman ’ s whim , dr. watson . when you know me better you will understand that I can not alway give reason for what I say or do. ” “ No , no . I rememb the thrill in your voic . I rememb the look in your eye . pleas , pleas , be frank with me , miss stapleton , for ever sinc I have been here I have been consciou of shadow all round me . life ha becom like that great grimpen mire , with littl green patch everywher into which one may sink and with no guid to point the track . tell me then what it wa that you meant , and I will promis to convey your warn to sir henry. ” An express of irresolut pass for an instant over her face , but her eye had harden again when she answer me . “ you make too much of it , dr. watson , ” said she . “ My brother and I were veri much shock by the death of sir charl . We knew him veri intim , for hi favourit walk wa over the moor to our hous . He wa deepli impress with the curs which hung over the famili , and when thi tragedi came I natur felt that there must be some ground for the fear which he had express . I wa distress therefor when anoth member of the famili came down to live here , and I felt that he should be warn of the danger which he will run . that wa all which I intend to convey . “ but what is the danger ? ” “ you know the stori of the hound ? ” “ I do not believ in such nonsense. ” “ but I do . If you have ani influenc with sir henri , take him away from a place which ha alway been fatal to hi famili . the world is wide . whi should he wish to live at the place of danger ? ” “ becaus it is the place of danger . that is sir henri ’ s natur . I fear that unless you can give me some more definit inform than thi it would be imposs to get him to move. ” “ I can not say anyth definit , for I do not know anyth definite. ” “ I would ask you one more question , miss stapleton . If you meant no more than thi when you first spoke to me , whi should you not wish your brother to overhear what you said ? there is noth to which he , or anyon els , could object. ” “ My brother is veri anxiou to have the hall inhabit , for he think it is for the good of the poor folk upon the moor . He would be veri angri if he knew that I have said anyth which might induc sir henri to go away . but I have done my duti now and I will say no more . I must go back , or he will miss me and suspect that I have seen you . good-by ! ” she turn and had disappear in a few minut among the scatter boulder , while I , with my soul full of vagu fear , pursu my way to baskervil hall . chapter 8 . first report of dr. watson from thi point onward I will follow the cours of event by transcrib my own letter to mr. sherlock holm which lie befor me on the tabl . one page is miss , but otherwis they are exactli as written and show my feel and suspicion of the moment more accur than my memori , clear as it is upon these tragic event , can possibl do . baskervil hall , octob 13th . MY dear holm : My previou letter and telegram have kept you pretti well up to date as to all that ha occur in thi most god-forsaken corner of the world . the longer one stay here the more doe the spirit of the moor sink into one ’ s soul , it vast , and also it grim charm . when you are onc out upon it bosom you have left all trace of modern england behind you , but , on the other hand , you are consciou everywher of the home and the work of the prehistor peopl . On all side of you as you walk are the hous of these forgotten folk , with their grave and the huge monolith which are suppos to have mark their templ . As you look at their gray stone hut against the scar hillsid you leav your own age behind you , and if you were to see a skin-clad , hairi man crawl out from the low door fit a flint-tip arrow on to the string of hi bow , you would feel that hi presenc there wa more natur than your own . the strang thing is that they should have live so thickli on what must alway have been most unfruit soil . I am no antiquarian , but I could imagin that they were some unwarlik and harri race who were forc to accept that which none other would occupi . all thi , howev , is foreign to the mission on which you sent me and will probabl be veri uninterest to your sever practic mind . I can still rememb your complet indiffer as to whether the sun move round the earth or the earth round the sun . let me , therefor , return to the fact concern sir henri baskervil . If you have not had ani report within the last few day it is becaus up to today there wa noth of import to relat . then a veri surpris circumst occur , which I shall tell you in due cours . but , first of all , I must keep you in touch with some of the other factor in the situat . one of these , concern which I have said littl , is the escap convict upon the moor . there is strong reason now to believ that he ha got right away , which is a consider relief to the lone household of thi district . A fortnight ha pass sinc hi flight , dure which he ha not been seen and noth ha been heard of him . It is sure inconceiv that he could have held out upon the moor dure all that time . Of cours , so far as hi conceal goe there is no difficulti at all . ani one of these stone hut would give him a hiding-plac . but there is noth to eat unless he were to catch and slaughter one of the moor sheep . We think , therefor , that he ha gone , and the outli farmer sleep the better in consequ . We are four able-bodi men in thi household , so that we could take good care of ourselv , but I confess that I have had uneasi moment when I have thought of the stapleton . they live mile from ani help . there are one maid , an old manserv , the sister , and the brother , the latter not a veri strong man . they would be helpless in the hand of a desper fellow like thi not hill crimin if he could onc effect an entranc . both sir henri and I were concern at their situat , and it wa suggest that perkin the groom should go over to sleep there , but stapleton would not hear of it . the fact is that our friend , the baronet , begin to display a consider interest in our fair neighbour . It is not to be wonder at , for time hang heavili in thi lone spot to an activ man like him , and she is a veri fascin and beauti woman . there is someth tropic and exot about her which form a singular contrast to her cool and unemot brother . yet he also give the idea of hidden fire . He ha certainli a veri mark influenc over her , for I have seen her continu glanc at him as she talk as if seek approb for what she said . I trust that he is kind to her . there is a dri glitter in hi eye and a firm set of hi thin lip , which goe with a posit and possibl a harsh natur . you would find him an interest studi . He came over to call upon baskervil on that first day , and the veri next morn he took us both to show us the spot where the legend of the wick hugo is suppos to have had it origin . It wa an excurs of some mile across the moor to a place which is so dismal that it might have suggest the stori . We found a short valley between rug tor which led to an open , grassi space fleck over with the white cotton grass . In the middl of it rose two great stone , worn and sharpen at the upper end until they look like the huge corrod fang of some monstrou beast . In everi way it correspond with the scene of the old tragedi . sir henri wa much interest and ask stapleton more than onc whether he did realli believ in the possibl of the interfer of the supernatur in the affair of men . He spoke lightli , but it wa evid that he wa veri much in earnest . stapleton wa guard in hi repli , but it wa easi to see that he said less than he might , and that he would not express hi whole opinion out of consider for the feel of the baronet . He told us of similar case , where famili had suffer from some evil influenc , and he left us with the impress that he share the popular view upon the matter . On our way back we stay for lunch at merripit hous , and it wa there that sir henri made the acquaint of miss stapleton . from the first moment that he saw her he appear to be strongli attract by her , and I am much mistaken if the feel wa not mutual . He refer to her again and again on our walk home , and sinc then hardli a day ha pass that we have not seen someth of the brother and sister . they dine here tonight , and there is some talk of our go to them next week . one would imagin that such a match would be veri welcom to stapleton , and yet I have more than onc caught a look of the strongest disapprob in hi face when sir henri ha been pay some attent to hi sister . He is much attach to her , no doubt , and would lead a lone life without her , but it would seem the height of selfish if he were to stand in the way of her make so brilliant a marriag . yet I am certain that he doe not wish their intimaci to ripen into love , and I have sever time observ that he ha taken pain to prevent them from be tete-a-tet . By the way , your instruct to me never to allow sir henri to go out alon will becom veri much more oner if a love affair were to be ad to our other difficulti . My popular would soon suffer if I were to carri out your order to the letter . the other day -- thursday , to be more exact -- dr. mortim lunch with us . He ha been excav a barrow at long down and ha got a prehistor skull which fill him with great joy . never wa there such a single-mind enthusiast as he ! the stapleton came in afterward , and the good doctor took us all to the yew alley at sir henri ’ s request to show us exactli how everyth occur upon that fatal night . It is a long , dismal walk , the yew alley , between two high wall of clip hedg , with a narrow band of grass upon either side . At the far end is an old tumble-down summer-hous . halfway down is the moor-gat , where the old gentleman left hi cigar-ash . It is a white wooden gate with a latch . beyond it lie the wide moor . I rememb your theori of the affair and tri to pictur all that had occur . As the old man stood there he saw someth come across the moor , someth which terrifi him so that he lost hi wit and ran and ran until he die of sheer horror and exhaust . there wa the long , gloomi tunnel down which he fled . and from what ? A sheep-dog of the moor ? Or a spectral hound , black , silent , and monstrou ? wa there a human agenc in the matter ? did the pale , watch barrymor know more than he care to say ? It wa all dim and vagu , but alway there is the dark shadow of crime behind it . one other neighbour I have met sinc I wrote last . thi is mr. frankland , of lafter hall , who live some four mile to the south of us . He is an elderli man , red-fac , white-hair , and choler . hi passion is for the british law , and he ha spent a larg fortun in litig . He fight for the mere pleasur of fight and is equal readi to take up either side of a question , so that it is no wonder that he ha found it a costli amus . sometim he will shut up a right of way and defi the parish to make him open it . At other he will with hi own hand tear down some other man ’ s gate and declar that a path ha exist there from time immemori , defi the owner to prosecut him for trespass . He is learn in old manori and commun right , and he appli hi knowledg sometim in favour of the villag of fernworthi and sometim against them , so that he is period either carri in triumph down the villag street or els burn in effigi , accord to hi latest exploit . He is said to have about seven lawsuit upon hi hand at present , which will probabl swallow up the remaind of hi fortun and so draw hi sting and leav him harmless for the futur . apart from the law he seem a kindli , good-natur person , and I onli mention him becaus you were particular that I should send some descript of the peopl who surround us . He is curious employ at present , for , be an amateur astronom , he ha an excel telescop , with which he lie upon the roof of hi own hous and sweep the moor all day in the hope of catch a glimps of the escap convict . If he would confin hi energi to thi all would be well , but there are rumour that he intend to prosecut dr. mortim for open a grave without the consent of the next of kin becaus he dug up the neolith skull in the barrow on long down . He help to keep our live from be monoton and give a littl comic relief where it is badli need . and now , have brought you up to date in the escap convict , the stapleton , dr. mortim , and frankland , of lafter hall , let me end on that which is most import and tell you more about the barrymor , and especi about the surpris develop of last night . first of all about the test telegram , which you sent from london in order to make sure that barrymor wa realli here . I have alreadi explain that the testimoni of the postmast show that the test wa worthless and that we have no proof one way or the other . I told sir henri how the matter stood , and he at onc , in hi downright fashion , had barrymor up and ask him whether he had receiv the telegram himself . barrymor said that he had . “ did the boy deliv it into your own hand ? ” ask sir henri . barrymor look surpris , and consid for a littl time . “ No , ” said he , “ I wa in the box-room at the time , and my wife brought it up to me. ” “ did you answer it yourself ? ” “ No ; I told my wife what to answer and she went down to write it. ” In the even he recur to the subject of hi own accord . “ I could not quit understand the object of your question thi morn , sir henri , ” said he . “ I trust that they do not mean that I have done anyth to forfeit your confid ? ” sir henri had to assur him that it wa not so and pacifi him by give him a consider part of hi old wardrob , the london outfit have now all arriv . mrs. barrymor is of interest to me . she is a heavi , solid person , veri limit , intens respect , and inclin to be puritan . you could hardli conceiv a less emot subject . yet I have told you how , on the first night here , I heard her sob bitterli , and sinc then I have more than onc observ trace of tear upon her face . some deep sorrow gnaw ever at her heart . sometim I wonder if she ha a guilti memori which haunt her , and sometim I suspect barrymor of be a domest tyrant . I have alway felt that there wa someth singular and question in thi man ’ s charact , but the adventur of last night bring all my suspicion to a head . and yet it may seem a small matter in itself . you are awar that I am not a veri sound sleeper , and sinc I have been on guard in thi hous my slumber have been lighter than ever . last night , about two in the morn , I wa arous by a stealthi step pass my room . I rose , open my door , and peep out . A long black shadow wa trail down the corridor . It wa thrown by a man who walk softli down the passag with a candl held in hi hand . He wa in shirt and trouser , with no cover to hi feet . I could mere see the outlin , but hi height told me that it wa barrymor . He walk veri slowli and circumspectli , and there wa someth indescrib guilti and furtiv in hi whole appear . I have told you that the corridor is broken by the balconi which run round the hall , but that it is resum upon the farther side . I wait until he had pass out of sight and then I follow him . when I came round the balconi he had reach the end of the farther corridor , and I could see from the glimmer of light through an open door that he had enter one of the room . now , all these room are unfurnish and unoccupi so that hi expedit becam more mysteri than ever . the light shone steadili as if he were stand motionless . I crept down the passag as noiselessli as I could and peep round the corner of the door . barrymor wa crouch at the window with the candl held against the glass . hi profil wa half turn toward me , and hi face seem to be rigid with expect as he stare out into the black of the moor . for some minut he stood watch intent . then he gave a deep groan and with an impati gestur he put out the light . instantli I made my way back to my room , and veri shortli came the stealthi step pass onc more upon their return journey . long afterward when I had fallen into a light sleep I heard a key turn somewher in a lock , but I could not tell whenc the sound came . what it all mean I can not guess , but there is some secret busi go on in thi hous of gloom which sooner or later we shall get to the bottom of . I do not troubl you with my theori , for you ask me to furnish you onli with fact . I have had a long talk with sir henri thi morn , and we have made a plan of campaign found upon my observ of last night . I will not speak about it just now , but it should make my next report interest read . chapter 9 . the light upon the moor [ second report of dr. watson ] baskervil hall , oct. 15th . MY dear holm : If I wa compel to leav you without much news dure the earli day of my mission you must acknowledg that I am make up for lost time , and that event are now crowd thick and fast upon us . In my last report I end upon my top note with barrymor at the window , and now I have quit a budget alreadi which will , unless I am much mistaken , consider surpris you . thing have taken a turn which I could not have anticip . In some way they have within the last forty-eight hour becom much clearer and in some way they have becom more complic . but I will tell you all and you shall judg for yourself . befor breakfast on the morn follow my adventur I went down the corridor and examin the room in which barrymor had been on the night befor . the western window through which he had stare so intent ha , I notic , one peculiar abov all other window in the hous -- it command the nearest outlook on to the moor . there is an open between two tree which enabl one from thi point of view to look right down upon it , while from all the other window it is onli a distant glimps which can be obtain . It follow , therefor , that barrymor , sinc onli thi window would serv the purpos , must have been look out for someth or somebodi upon the moor . the night wa veri dark , so that I can hardli imagin how he could have hope to see anyon . It had struck me that it wa possibl that some love intrigu wa on foot . that would have account for hi stealthi movement and also for the uneasi of hi wife . the man is a striking-look fellow , veri well equip to steal the heart of a countri girl , so that thi theori seem to have someth to support it . that open of the door which I had heard after I had return to my room might mean that he had gone out to keep some clandestin appoint . So I reason with myself in the morn , and I tell you the direct of my suspicion , howev much the result may have shown that they were unfound . but whatev the true explan of barrymor ’ s movement might be , I felt that the respons of keep them to myself until I could explain them wa more than I could bear . I had an interview with the baronet in hi studi after breakfast , and I told him all that I had seen . He wa less surpris than I had expect . “ I knew that barrymor walk about night , and I had a mind to speak to him about it , ” said he . “ two or three time I have heard hi step in the passag , come and go , just about the hour you name. ” “ perhap then he pay a visit everi night to that particular window , ” I suggest . “ perhap he doe . If so , we should be abl to shadow him and see what it is that he is after . I wonder what your friend holm would do if he were here. ” “ I believ that he would do exactli what you now suggest , ” said I . “ He would follow barrymor and see what he did. ” “ then we shall do it together. ” “ but sure he would hear us. ” “ the man is rather deaf , and in ani case we must take our chanc of that . We ’ ll sit up in my room tonight and wait until he passes. ” sir henri rub hi hand with pleasur , and it wa evid that he hail the adventur as a relief to hi somewhat quiet life upon the moor . the baronet ha been in commun with the architect who prepar the plan for sir charl , and with a contractor from london , so that we may expect great chang to begin here soon . there have been decor and furnish up from plymouth , and it is evid that our friend ha larg idea and mean to spare no pain or expens to restor the grandeur of hi famili . when the hous is renov and refurnish , all that he will need will be a wife to make it complet . between ourselv there are pretti clear sign that thi will not be want if the ladi is will , for I have seldom seen a man more infatu with a woman than he is with our beauti neighbour , miss stapleton . and yet the cours of true love doe not run quit as smoothli as one would under the circumst expect . today , for exampl , it surfac wa broken by a veri unexpect rippl , which ha caus our friend consider perplex and annoy . after the convers which I have quot about barrymor , sir henri put on hi hat and prepar to go out . As a matter of cours I did the same . “ what , are you come , watson ? ” he ask , look at me in a curiou way . “ that depend on whether you are go on the moor , ” said I . “ ye , I am. ” “ well , you know what my instruct are . I am sorri to intrud , but you heard how earnestli holm insist that I should not leav you , and especi that you should not go alon upon the moor. ” sir henri put hi hand upon my shoulder with a pleasant smile . “ My dear fellow , ” said he , “ holm , with all hi wisdom , did not forese some thing which have happen sinc I have been on the moor . you understand me ? I am sure that you are the last man in the world who would wish to be a spoil-sport . I must go out alone. ” It put me in a most awkward posit . I wa at a loss what to say or what to do , and befor I had made up my mind he pick up hi cane and wa gone . but when I came to think the matter over my conscienc reproach me bitterli for have on ani pretext allow him to go out of my sight . I imagin what my feel would be if I had to return to you and to confess that some misfortun had occur through my disregard for your instruct . I assur you my cheek flush at the veri thought . It might not even now be too late to overtak him , so I set off at onc in the direct of merripit hous . I hurri along the road at the top of my speed without see anyth of sir henri , until I came to the point where the moor path branch off . there , fear that perhap I had come in the wrong direct after all , I mount a hill from which I could command a view -- the same hill which is cut into the dark quarri . thenc I saw him at onc . He wa on the moor path about a quarter of a mile off , and a ladi wa by hi side who could onli be miss stapleton . It wa clear that there wa alreadi an understand between them and that they had met by appoint . they were walk slowli along in deep convers , and I saw her make quick littl movement of her hand as if she were veri earnest in what she wa say , while he listen intent , and onc or twice shook hi head in strong dissent . I stood among the rock watch them , veri much puzzl as to what I should do next . To follow them and break into their intim convers seem to be an outrag , and yet my clear duti wa never for an instant to let him out of my sight . To act the spi upon a friend wa a hate task . still , I could see no better cours than to observ him from the hill , and to clear my conscienc by confess to him afterward what I had done . It is true that if ani sudden danger had threaten him I wa too far away to be of use , and yet I am sure that you will agre with me that the posit wa veri difficult , and that there wa noth more which I could do . our friend , sir henri , and the ladi had halt on the path and were stand deepli absorb in their convers , when I wa suddenli awar that I wa not the onli wit of their interview . A wisp of green float in the air caught my eye , and anoth glanc show me that it wa carri on a stick by a man who wa move among the broken ground . It wa stapleton with hi butterfly-net . He wa veri much closer to the pair than I wa , and he appear to be move in their direct . At thi instant sir henri suddenli drew miss stapleton to hi side . hi arm wa round her , but it seem to me that she wa strain away from him with her face avert . He stoop hi head to her , and she rais one hand as if in protest . next moment I saw them spring apart and turn hurriedli round . stapleton wa the caus of the interrupt . He wa run wildli toward them , hi absurd net dangl behind him . He gesticul and almost danc with excit in front of the lover . what the scene meant I could not imagin , but it seem to me that stapleton wa abus sir henri , who offer explan , which becam more angri as the other refus to accept them . the ladi stood by in haughti silenc . final stapleton turn upon hi heel and beckon in a peremptori way to hi sister , who , after an irresolut glanc at sir henri , walk off by the side of her brother . the naturalist ’ s angri gestur show that the ladi wa includ in hi displeasur . the baronet stood for a minut look after them , and then he walk slowli back the way that he had come , hi head hang , the veri pictur of deject . what all thi meant I could not imagin , but I wa deepli asham to have wit so intim a scene without my friend ’ s knowledg . I ran down the hill therefor and met the baronet at the bottom . hi face wa flush with anger and hi brow were wrinkl , like one who is at hi wit ’ s end what to do . “ halloa , watson ! where have you drop from ? ” said he . “ you don ’ t mean to say that you came after me in spite of all ? ” I explain everyth to him : how I had found it imposs to remain behind , how I had follow him , and how I had wit all that had occur . for an instant hi eye blaze at me , but my frank disarm hi anger , and he broke at last into a rather rueful laugh . “ you would have thought the middl of that prairi a fairli safe place for a man to be privat , ” said he , “ but , by thunder , the whole countrysid seem to have been out to see me do my woo -- and a mighti poor woo at that ! where had you engag a seat ? ” “ I wa on that hill. ” “ quit in the back row , eh ? but her brother wa well up to the front . did you see him come out on us ? ” “ ye , I did. ” “ did he ever strike you as be crazi -- thi brother of her ? ” “ I can ’ t say that he ever did. ” “ I dare say not . I alway thought him sane enough until today , but you can take it from me that either he or I ought to be in a straitjacket . what ’ s the matter with me , anyhow ? you ’ ve live near me for some week , watson . tell me straight , now ! Is there anyth that would prevent me from make a good husband to a woman that I love ? ” “ I should say not. ” “ He can ’ t object to my worldli posit , so it must be myself that he ha thi down on . what ha he against me ? I never hurt man or woman in my life that I know of . and yet he would not so much as let me touch the tip of her fingers. ” “ did he say so ? ” “ that , and a deal more . I tell you , watson , I ’ ve onli known her these few week , but from the first I just felt that she wa made for me , and she , too -- she wa happi when she wa with me , and that I ’ ll swear . there ’ s a light in a woman ’ s eye that speak louder than word . but he ha never let us get togeth and it wa onli today for the first time that I saw a chanc of have a few word with her alon . she wa glad to meet me , but when she did it wa not love that she would talk about , and she wouldn ’ t have let me talk about it either if she could have stop it . she kept come back to it that thi wa a place of danger , and that she would never be happi until I had left it . I told her that sinc I had seen her I wa in no hurri to leav it , and that if she realli want me to go , the onli way to work it wa for her to arrang to go with me . with that I offer in as mani word to marri her , but befor she could answer , down came thi brother of her , run at us with a face on him like a madman . He wa just white with rage , and those light eye of hi were blaze with furi . what wa I do with the ladi ? how dare I offer her attent which were distast to her ? did I think that becaus I wa a baronet I could do what I like ? If he had not been her brother I should have known better how to answer him . As it wa I told him that my feel toward hi sister were such as I wa not asham of , and that I hope that she might honour me by becom my wife . that seem to make the matter no better , so then I lost my temper too , and I answer him rather more hotli than I should perhap , consid that she wa stand by . So it end by hi go off with her , as you saw , and here am I as badli puzzl a man as ani in thi counti . just tell me what it all mean , watson , and I ’ ll owe you more than ever I can hope to pay. ” I tri one or two explan , but , inde , I wa complet puzzl myself . our friend ’ s titl , hi fortun , hi age , hi charact , and hi appear are all in hi favour , and I know noth against him unless it be thi dark fate which run in hi famili . that hi advanc should be reject so brusqu without ani refer to the ladi ’ s own wish and that the ladi should accept the situat without protest is veri amaz . howev , our conjectur were set at rest by a visit from stapleton himself that veri afternoon . He had come to offer apolog for hi rude of the morn , and after a long privat interview with sir henri in hi studi the upshot of their convers wa that the breach is quit heal , and that we are to dine at merripit hous next friday as a sign of it . “ I don ’ t say now that he isn ’ t a crazi man , ” said sir henri ; “ I can ’ t forget the look in hi eye when he ran at me thi morn , but I must allow that no man could make a more handsom apolog than he ha done. ” “ did he give ani explan of hi conduct ? ” “ hi sister is everyth in hi life , he say . that is natur enough , and I am glad that he should understand her valu . they have alway been togeth , and accord to hi account he ha been a veri lone man with onli her as a companion , so that the thought of lose her wa realli terribl to him . He had not understood , he said , that I wa becom attach to her , but when he saw with hi own eye that it wa realli so , and that she might be taken away from him , it gave him such a shock that for a time he wa not respons for what he said or did . He wa veri sorri for all that had pass , and he recogn how foolish and how selfish it wa that he should imagin that he could hold a beauti woman like hi sister to himself for her whole life . If she had to leav him he had rather it wa to a neighbour like myself than to anyon els . but in ani case it wa a blow to him and it would take him some time befor he could prepar himself to meet it . He would withdraw all opposit upon hi part if I would promis for three month to let the matter rest and to be content with cultiv the ladi ’ s friendship dure that time without claim her love . thi I promis , and so the matter rests. ” So there is one of our small mysteri clear up . It is someth to have touch bottom anywher in thi bog in which we are flounder . We know now whi stapleton look with disfavour upon hi sister ’ s suitor -- even when that suitor wa so elig a one as sir henri . and now I pass on to anoth thread which I have extric out of the tangl skein , the mysteri of the sob in the night , of the tear-stain face of mrs. barrymor , of the secret journey of the butler to the western lattic window . congratul me , my dear holm , and tell me that I have not disappoint you as an agent -- that you do not regret the confid which you show in me when you sent me down . all these thing have by one night ’ s work been thoroughli clear . I have said “ by one night ’ s work , ” but , in truth , it wa by two night ’ work , for on the first we drew entir blank . I sat up with sir henri in hi room until nearli three o ’ clock in the morn , but no sound of ani sort did we hear except the chime clock upon the stair . It wa a most melancholi vigil and end by each of us fall asleep in our chair . fortun we were not discourag , and we determin to tri again . the next night we lower the lamp and sat smoke cigarett without make the least sound . It wa incred how slowli the hour crawl by , and yet we were help through it by the same sort of patient interest which the hunter must feel as he watch the trap into which he hope the game may wander . one struck , and two , and we had almost for the second time given it up in despair when in an instant we both sat bolt upright in our chair with all our weari sens keenli on the alert onc more . We had heard the creak of a step in the passag . veri stealthili we heard it pass along until it die away in the distanc . then the baronet gentli open hi door and we set out in pursuit . alreadi our man had gone round the galleri and the corridor wa all in dark . softli we stole along until we had come into the other wing . We were just in time to catch a glimps of the tall , black-beard figur , hi shoulder round as he tipto down the passag . then he pass through the same door as befor , and the light of the candl frame it in the dark and shot one singl yellow beam across the gloom of the corridor . We shuffl cautious toward it , tri everi plank befor we dare to put our whole weight upon it . We had taken the precaut of leav our boot behind us , but , even so , the old board snap and creak beneath our tread . sometim it seem imposs that he should fail to hear our approach . howev , the man is fortun rather deaf , and he wa entir preoccupi in that which he wa do . when at last we reach the door and peep through we found him crouch at the window , candl in hand , hi white , intent face press against the pane , exactli as I had seen him two night befor . We had arrang no plan of campaign , but the baronet is a man to whom the most direct way is alway the most natur . He walk into the room , and as he did so barrymor sprang up from the window with a sharp hiss of hi breath and stood , livid and trembl , befor us . hi dark eye , glare out of the white mask of hi face , were full of horror and astonish as he gaze from sir henri to me . “ what are you do here , barrymor ? ” “ noth , sir. ” hi agit wa so great that he could hardli speak , and the shadow sprang up and down from the shake of hi candl . “ It wa the window , sir . I go round at night to see that they are fastened. ” “ On the second floor ? ” “ ye , sir , all the windows. ” “ look here , barrymor , ” said sir henri sternli , “ we have made up our mind to have the truth out of you , so it will save you troubl to tell it sooner rather than later . come , now ! No lie ! what were you do at that window ? ” the fellow look at us in a helpless way , and he wrung hi hand togeth like one who is in the last extrem of doubt and miseri . “ I wa do no harm , sir . I wa hold a candl to the window. ” “ and whi were you hold a candl to the window ? ” “ don ’ t ask me , sir henri -- don ’ t ask me ! I give you my word , sir , that it is not my secret , and that I can not tell it . If it concern no one but myself I would not tri to keep it from you. ” A sudden idea occur to me , and I took the candl from the trembl hand of the butler . “ He must have been hold it as a signal , ” said I . “ let us see if there is ani answer. ” I held it as he had done , and stare out into the dark of the night . vagu I could discern the black bank of the tree and the lighter expans of the moor , for the moon wa behind the cloud . and then I gave a cri of exult , for a tini pinpoint of yellow light had suddenli transfix the dark veil , and glow steadili in the centr of the black squar frame by the window . “ there it is ! ” I cri . “ No , no , sir , it is noth -- noth at all ! ” the butler broke in ; “ I assur you , sir -- ” “ move your light across the window , watson ! ” cri the baronet . “ see , the other move also ! now , you rascal , do you deni that it is a signal ? come , speak up ! who is your confeder out yonder , and what is thi conspiraci that is go on ? ” the man ’ s face becam openli defiant . “ It is my busi , and not your . I will not tell. ” “ then you leav my employ right away. ” “ veri good , sir . If I must I must. ” “ and you go in disgrac . By thunder , you may well be asham of yourself . your famili ha live with mine for over a hundr year under thi roof , and here I find you deep in some dark plot against me. ” “ No , no , sir ; no , not against you ! ” It wa a woman ’ s voic , and mrs. barrymor , paler and more horror-struck than her husband , wa stand at the door . her bulki figur in a shawl and skirt might have been comic were it not for the intens of feel upon her face . “ We have to go , eliza . thi is the end of it . you can pack our thing , ” said the butler . “ Oh , john , john , have I brought you to thi ? It is my do , sir henri -- all mine . He ha done noth except for my sake and becaus I ask him. ” “ speak out , then ! what doe it mean ? ” “ My unhappi brother is starv on the moor . We can not let him perish at our veri gate . the light is a signal to him that food is readi for him , and hi light out yonder is to show the spot to which to bring it. ” “ then your brother is -- ” “ the escap convict , sir -- selden , the criminal. ” “ that ’ s the truth , sir , ” said barrymor . “ I said that it wa not my secret and that I could not tell it to you . but now you have heard it , and you will see that if there wa a plot it wa not against you. ” thi , then , wa the explan of the stealthi expedit at night and the light at the window . sir henri and I both stare at the woman in amaz . wa it possibl that thi stolidli respect person wa of the same blood as one of the most notori crimin in the countri ? “ ye , sir , my name wa selden , and he is my younger brother . We humour him too much when he wa a lad and gave him hi own way in everyth until he came to think that the world wa made for hi pleasur , and that he could do what he like in it . then as he grew older he met wick companion , and the devil enter into him until he broke my mother ’ s heart and drag our name in the dirt . from crime to crime he sank lower and lower until it is onli the merci of god which ha snatch him from the scaffold ; but to me , sir , he wa alway the littl curly-head boy that I had nurs and play with as an elder sister would . that wa whi he broke prison , sir . He knew that I wa here and that we could not refus to help him . when he drag himself here one night , weari and starv , with the warder hard at hi heel , what could we do ? We took him in and fed him and care for him . then you return , sir , and my brother thought he would be safer on the moor than anywher els until the hue and cri wa over , so he lay in hide there . but everi second night we made sure if he wa still there by put a light in the window , and if there wa an answer my husband took out some bread and meat to him . everi day we hope that he wa gone , but as long as he wa there we could not desert him . that is the whole truth , as I am an honest christian woman and you will see that if there is blame in the matter it doe not lie with my husband but with me , for whose sake he ha done all that he has. ” the woman ’ s word came with an intens earnest which carri convict with them . “ Is thi true , barrymor ? ” “ ye , sir henri . everi word of it. ” “ well , I can not blame you for stand by your own wife . forget what I have said . Go to your room , you two , and we shall talk further about thi matter in the morning. ” when they were gone we look out of the window again . sir henri had flung it open , and the cold night wind beat in upon our face . far away in the black distanc there still glow that one tini point of yellow light . “ I wonder he dare , ” said sir henri . “ It may be so place as to be onli visibl from here. ” “ veri like . how far do you think it is ? ” “ out by the cleft tor , I think. ” “ not more than a mile or two off. ” “ hardli that. ” “ well , it can not be far if barrymor had to carri out the food to it . and he is wait , thi villain , besid that candl . By thunder , watson , I am go out to take that man ! ” the same thought had cross my own mind . It wa not as if the barrymor had taken us into their confid . their secret had been forc from them . the man wa a danger to the commun , an unmitig scoundrel for whom there wa neither piti nor excus . We were onli do our duti in take thi chanc of put him back where he could do no harm . with hi brutal and violent natur , other would have to pay the price if we held our hand . ani night , for exampl , our neighbour the stapleton might be attack by him , and it may have been the thought of thi which made sir henri so keen upon the adventur . “ I will come , ” said I . “ then get your revolv and put on your boot . the sooner we start the better , as the fellow may put out hi light and be off. ” In five minut we were outsid the door , start upon our expedit . We hurri through the dark shrubberi , amid the dull moan of the autumn wind and the rustl of the fall leav . the night air wa heavi with the smell of damp and decay . now and again the moon peep out for an instant , but cloud were drive over the face of the sky , and just as we came out on the moor a thin rain began to fall . the light still burn steadili in front . “ are you arm ? ” I ask . “ I have a hunting-crop. ” “ We must close in on him rapidli , for he is said to be a desper fellow . We shall take him by surpris and have him at our merci befor he can resist. ” “ I say , watson , ” said the baronet , “ what would holm say to thi ? how about that hour of dark in which the power of evil is exalt ? ” As if in answer to hi word there rose suddenli out of the vast gloom of the moor that strang cri which I had alreadi heard upon the border of the great grimpen mire . It came with the wind through the silenc of the night , a long , deep mutter , then a rise howl , and then the sad moan in which it die away . again and again it sound , the whole air throb with it , strident , wild , and menac . the baronet caught my sleev and hi face glimmer white through the dark . “ My god , what ’ s that , watson ? ” “ I don ’ t know . It ’ s a sound they have on the moor . I heard it onc before. ” It die away , and an absolut silenc close in upon us . We stood strain our ear , but noth came . “ watson , ” said the baronet , “ it wa the cri of a hound. ” My blood ran cold in my vein , for there wa a break in hi voic which told of the sudden horror which had seiz him . “ what do they call thi sound ? ” he ask . “ who ? ” “ the folk on the countryside. ” “ Oh , they are ignor peopl . whi should you mind what they call it ? ” “ tell me , watson . what do they say of it ? ” I hesit but could not escap the question . “ they say it is the cri of the hound of the baskervilles. ” He groan and wa silent for a few moment . “ A hound it wa , ” he said at last , “ but it seem to come from mile away , over yonder , I think. ” “ It wa hard to say whenc it came. ” “ It rose and fell with the wind . isn ’ t that the direct of the great grimpen mire ? ” “ ye , it is. ” “ well , it wa up there . come now , watson , didn ’ t you think yourself that it wa the cri of a hound ? I am not a child . you need not fear to speak the truth. ” “ stapleton wa with me when I heard it last . He said that it might be the call of a strang bird. ” “ No , no , it wa a hound . My god , can there be some truth in all these stori ? Is it possibl that I am realli in danger from so dark a caus ? you don ’ t believ it , do you , watson ? ” “ No , no. ” “ and yet it wa one thing to laugh about it in london , and it is anoth to stand out here in the dark of the moor and to hear such a cri as that . and my uncl ! there wa the footprint of the hound besid him as he lay . It all fit togeth . I don ’ t think that I am a coward , watson , but that sound seem to freez my veri blood . feel my hand ! ” It wa as cold as a block of marbl . “ you ’ ll be all right tomorrow. ” “ I don ’ t think I ’ ll get that cri out of my head . what do you advis that we do now ? ” “ shall we turn back ? ” “ No , by thunder ; we have come out to get our man , and we will do it . We after the convict , and a hell-hound , as like as not , after us . come on ! We ’ ll see it through if all the fiend of the pit were loos upon the moor. ” We stumbl slowli along in the dark , with the black loom of the craggi hill around us , and the yellow speck of light burn steadili in front . there is noth so decept as the distanc of a light upon a pitch-dark night , and sometim the glimmer seem to be far away upon the horizon and sometim it might have been within a few yard of us . but at last we could see whenc it came , and then we knew that we were inde veri close . A gutter candl wa stuck in a crevic of the rock which flank it on each side so as to keep the wind from it and also to prevent it from be visibl , save in the direct of baskervil hall . A boulder of granit conceal our approach , and crouch behind it we gaze over it at the signal light . It wa strang to see thi singl candl burn there in the middl of the moor , with no sign of life near it -- just the one straight yellow flame and the gleam of the rock on each side of it . “ what shall we do now ? ” whisper sir henri . “ wait here . He must be near hi light . let us see if we can get a glimps of him. ” the word were hardli out of my mouth when we both saw him . over the rock , in the crevic of which the candl burn , there wa thrust out an evil yellow face , a terribl anim face , all seam and score with vile passion . foul with mire , with a bristl beard , and hung with mat hair , it might well have belong to one of those old savag who dwelt in the burrow on the hillsid . the light beneath him wa reflect in hi small , cun eye which peer fierc to right and left through the dark like a crafti and savag anim who ha heard the step of the hunter . someth had evid arous hi suspicion . It may have been that barrymor had some privat signal which we had neglect to give , or the fellow may have had some other reason for think that all wa not well , but I could read hi fear upon hi wick face . ani instant he might dash out the light and vanish in the dark . I sprang forward therefor , and sir henri did the same . At the same moment the convict scream out a curs at us and hurl a rock which splinter up against the boulder which had shelter us . I caught one glimps of hi short , squat , strongli built figur as he sprang to hi feet and turn to run . At the same moment by a lucki chanc the moon broke through the cloud . We rush over the brow of the hill , and there wa our man run with great speed down the other side , spring over the stone in hi way with the activ of a mountain goat . A lucki long shot of my revolv might have crippl him , but I had brought it onli to defend myself if attack and not to shoot an unarm man who wa run away . We were both swift runner and in fairli good train , but we soon found that we had no chanc of overtak him . We saw him for a long time in the moonlight until he wa onli a small speck move swiftli among the boulder upon the side of a distant hill . We ran and ran until we were complet blown , but the space between us grew ever wider . final we stop and sat pant on two rock , while we watch him disappear in the distanc . and it wa at thi moment that there occur a most strang and unexpect thing . We had risen from our rock and were turn to go home , have abandon the hopeless chase . the moon wa low upon the right , and the jag pinnacl of a granit tor stood up against the lower curv of it silver disc . there , outlin as black as an eboni statu on that shine background , I saw the figur of a man upon the tor . Do not think that it wa a delus , holm . I assur you that I have never in my life seen anyth more clearli . As far as I could judg , the figur wa that of a tall , thin man . He stood with hi leg a littl separ , hi arm fold , hi head bow , as if he were brood over that enorm wilder of peat and granit which lay befor him . He might have been the veri spirit of that terribl place . It wa not the convict . thi man wa far from the place where the latter had disappear . besid , he wa a much taller man . with a cri of surpris I point him out to the baronet , but in the instant dure which I had turn to grasp hi arm the man wa gone . there wa the sharp pinnacl of granit still cut the lower edg of the moon , but it peak bore no trace of that silent and motionless figur . I wish to go in that direct and to search the tor , but it wa some distanc away . the baronet ’ s nerv were still quiver from that cri , which recal the dark stori of hi famili , and he wa not in the mood for fresh adventur . He had not seen thi lone man upon the tor and could not feel the thrill which hi strang presenc and hi command attitud had given to me . “ A warder , no doubt , ” said he . “ the moor ha been thick with them sinc thi fellow escaped. ” well , perhap hi explan may be the right one , but I should like to have some further proof of it . today we mean to commun to the princetown peopl where they should look for their miss man , but it is hard line that we have not actual had the triumph of bring him back as our own prison . such are the adventur of last night , and you must acknowledg , my dear holm , that I have done you veri well in the matter of a report . much of what I tell you is no doubt quit irrelev , but still I feel that it is best that I should let you have all the fact and leav you to select for yourself those which will be of most servic to you in help you to your conclus . We are certainli make some progress . So far as the barrymor go we have found the motiv of their action , and that ha clear up the situat veri much . but the moor with it mysteri and it strang inhabit remain as inscrut as ever . perhap in my next I may be abl to throw some light upon thi also . best of all would it be if you could come down to us . In ani case you will hear from me again in the cours of the next few day . chapter 10 . extract from the diari of dr. watson So far I have been abl to quot from the report which I have forward dure these earli day to sherlock holm . now , howev , I have arriv at a point in my narr where I am compel to abandon thi method and to trust onc more to my recollect , aid by the diari which I kept at the time . A few extract from the latter will carri me on to those scene which are indel fix in everi detail upon my memori . I proceed , then , from the morn which follow our abort chase of the convict and our other strang experi upon the moor . octob 16th . A dull and foggi day with a drizzl of rain . the hous is bank in with roll cloud , which rise now and then to show the dreari curv of the moor , with thin , silver vein upon the side of the hill , and the distant boulder gleam where the light strike upon their wet face . It is melancholi outsid and in . the baronet is in a black reaction after the excit of the night . I am consciou myself of a weight at my heart and a feel of impend danger -- ever present danger , which is the more terribl becaus I am unabl to defin it . and have I not caus for such a feel ? consid the long sequenc of incid which have all point to some sinist influenc which is at work around us . there is the death of the last occup of the hall , fulfil so exactli the condit of the famili legend , and there are the repeat report from peasant of the appear of a strang creatur upon the moor . twice I have with my own ear heard the sound which resembl the distant bay of a hound . It is incred , imposs , that it should realli be outsid the ordinari law of natur . A spectral hound which leav materi footmark and fill the air with it howl is sure not to be thought of . stapleton may fall in with such a superstit , and mortim also , but if I have one qualiti upon earth it is common sens , and noth will persuad me to believ in such a thing . To do so would be to descend to the level of these poor peasant , who are not content with a mere fiend dog but must need describ him with hell-fir shoot from hi mouth and eye . holm would not listen to such fanci , and I am hi agent . but fact are fact , and I have twice heard thi cri upon the moor . suppos that there were realli some huge hound loos upon it ; that would go far to explain everyth . but where could such a hound lie conceal , where did it get it food , where did it come from , how wa it that no one saw it by day ? It must be confess that the natur explan offer almost as mani difficulti as the other . and alway , apart from the hound , there is the fact of the human agenc in london , the man in the cab , and the letter which warn sir henri against the moor . thi at least wa real , but it might have been the work of a protect friend as easili as of an enemi . where is that friend or enemi now ? ha he remain in london , or ha he follow us down here ? could he -- could he be the stranger whom I saw upon the tor ? It is true that I have had onli the one glanc at him , and yet there are some thing to which I am readi to swear . He is no one whom I have seen down here , and I have now met all the neighbour . the figur wa far taller than that of stapleton , far thinner than that of frankland . barrymor it might possibl have been , but we had left him behind us , and I am certain that he could not have follow us . A stranger then is still dog us , just as a stranger dog us in london . We have never shaken him off . If I could lay my hand upon that man , then at last we might find ourselv at the end of all our difficulti . To thi one purpos I must now devot all my energi . My first impuls wa to tell sir henri all my plan . My second and wisest one is to play my own game and speak as littl as possibl to anyon . He is silent and distrait . hi nerv have been strang shaken by that sound upon the moor . I will say noth to add to hi anxieti , but I will take my own step to attain my own end . We had a small scene thi morn after breakfast . barrymor ask leav to speak with sir henri , and they were closet in hi studi some littl time . sit in the billiard-room I more than onc heard the sound of voic rais , and I had a pretti good idea what the point wa which wa under discuss . after a time the baronet open hi door and call for me . “ barrymor consid that he ha a grievanc , ” he said . “ He think that it wa unfair on our part to hunt hi brother-in-law down when he , of hi own free will , had told us the secret. ” the butler wa stand veri pale but veri collect befor us . “ I may have spoken too warmli , sir , ” said he , “ and if I have , I am sure that I beg your pardon . At the same time , I wa veri much surpris when I heard you two gentlemen come back thi morn and learn that you had been chase selden . the poor fellow ha enough to fight against without my put more upon hi track. ” “ If you had told us of your own free will it would have been a differ thing , ” said the baronet , “ you onli told us , or rather your wife onli told us , when it wa forc from you and you could not help yourself. ” “ I didn ’ t think you would have taken advantag of it , sir henri -- inde I didn ’ t. ” “ the man is a public danger . there are lone hous scatter over the moor , and he is a fellow who would stick at noth . you onli want to get a glimps of hi face to see that . look at mr. stapleton ’ s hous , for exampl , with no one but himself to defend it . there ’ s no safeti for anyon until he is under lock and key. ” “ He ’ ll break into no hous , sir . I give you my solemn word upon that . but he will never troubl anyon in thi countri again . I assur you , sir henri , that in a veri few day the necessari arrang will have been made and he will be on hi way to south america . for god ’ s sake , sir , I beg of you not to let the polic know that he is still on the moor . they have given up the chase there , and he can lie quiet until the ship is readi for him . you can ’ t tell on him without get my wife and me into troubl . I beg you , sir , to say noth to the police. ” “ what do you say , watson ? ” I shrug my shoulder . “ If he were safe out of the countri it would reliev the tax-pay of a burden. ” “ but how about the chanc of hi hold someon up befor he goe ? ” “ He would not do anyth so mad , sir . We have provid him with all that he can want . To commit a crime would be to show where he wa hiding. ” “ that is true , ” said sir henri . “ well , barrymor -- ” “ god bless you , sir , and thank you from my heart ! It would have kill my poor wife had he been taken again. ” “ I guess we are aid and abet a feloni , watson ? but , after what we have heard I don ’ t feel as if I could give the man up , so there is an end of it . all right , barrymor , you can go. ” with a few broken word of gratitud the man turn , but he hesit and then came back . “ you ’ ve been so kind to us , sir , that I should like to do the best I can for you in return . I know someth , sir henri , and perhap I should have said it befor , but it wa long after the inquest that I found it out . I ’ ve never breath a word about it yet to mortal man . It ’ s about poor sir charl ’ s death. ” the baronet and I were both upon our feet . “ Do you know how he die ? ” “ No , sir , I don ’ t know that. ” “ what then ? ” “ I know whi he wa at the gate at that hour . It wa to meet a woman. ” “ To meet a woman ! He ? ” “ ye , sir. ” “ and the woman ’ s name ? ” “ I can ’ t give you the name , sir , but I can give you the initi . her initi were L. L. ” “ how do you know thi , barrymor ? ” “ well , sir henri , your uncl had a letter that morn . He had usual a great mani letter , for he wa a public man and well known for hi kind heart , so that everyon who wa in troubl wa glad to turn to him . but that morn , as it chanc , there wa onli thi one letter , so I took the more notic of it . It wa from coomb tracey , and it wa address in a woman ’ s hand. ” “ well ? ” “ well , sir , I thought no more of the matter , and never would have done had it not been for my wife . onli a few week ago she wa clean out sir charl ’ s studi -- it had never been touch sinc hi death -- and she found the ash of a burn letter in the back of the grate . the greater part of it wa char to piec , but one littl slip , the end of a page , hung togeth , and the write could still be read , though it wa gray on a black ground . It seem to us to be a postscript at the end of the letter and it said : ‘ pleas , pleas , as you are a gentleman , burn thi letter , and be at the gate by ten o clock . beneath it were sign the initi L. L. ” “ have you got that slip ? ” “ No , sir , it crumbl all to bit after we move it. ” “ had sir charl receiv ani other letter in the same write ? ” “ well , sir , I took no particular notic of hi letter . I should not have notic thi one , onli it happen to come alone. ” “ and you have no idea who L. L. is ? ” “ No , sir . No more than you have . but I expect if we could lay our hand upon that ladi we should know more about sir charl ’ s death. ” “ I can not understand , barrymor , how you came to conceal thi import information. ” “ well , sir , it wa immedi after that our own troubl came to us . and then again , sir , we were both of us veri fond of sir charl , as we well might be consid all that he ha done for us . To rake thi up couldn ’ t help our poor master , and it ’ s well to go care when there ’ s a ladi in the case . even the best of us -- ” “ you thought it might injur hi reput ? ” “ well , sir , I thought no good could come of it . but now you have been kind to us , and I feel as if it would be treat you unfairli not to tell you all that I know about the matter. ” “ veri good , barrymor ; you can go. ” when the butler had left us sir henri turn to me . “ well , watson , what do you think of thi new light ? ” “ It seem to leav the dark rather blacker than before. ” “ So I think . but if we can onli trace L. L. it should clear up the whole busi . We have gain that much . We know that there is someon who ha the fact if we can onli find her . what do you think we should do ? ” “ let holm know all about it at onc . It will give him the clue for which he ha been seek . I am much mistaken if it doe not bring him down. ” I went at onc to my room and drew up my report of the morn ’ s convers for holm . It wa evid to me that he had been veri busi of late , for the note which I had from baker street were few and short , with no comment upon the inform which I had suppli and hardli ani refer to my mission . No doubt hi blackmail case is absorb all hi faculti . and yet thi new factor must sure arrest hi attent and renew hi interest . I wish that he were here . octob 17th . all day today the rain pour down , rustl on the ivi and drip from the eav . I thought of the convict out upon the bleak , cold , shelterless moor . poor devil ! whatev hi crime , he ha suffer someth to aton for them . and then I thought of that other one -- the face in the cab , the figur against the moon . wa he also out in that delug -- the unseen watcher , the man of dark ? In the even I put on my waterproof and I walk far upon the sodden moor , full of dark imagin , the rain beat upon my face and the wind whistl about my ear . god help those who wander into the great mire now , for even the firm upland are becom a morass . I found the black tor upon which I had seen the solitari watcher , and from it craggi summit I look out myself across the melancholi down . rain squall drift across their russet face , and the heavi , slate-colour cloud hung low over the landscap , trail in gray wreath down the side of the fantast hill . In the distant hollow on the left , half hidden by the mist , the two thin tower of baskervil hall rose abov the tree . they were the onli sign of human life which I could see , save onli those prehistor hut which lay thickli upon the slope of the hill . nowher wa there ani trace of that lone man whom I had seen on the same spot two night befor . As I walk back I wa overtaken by dr. mortim drive in hi dog-cart over a rough moorland track which led from the outli farmhous of foulmir . He ha been veri attent to us , and hardli a day ha pass that he ha not call at the hall to see how we were get on . He insist upon my climb into hi dog-cart , and he gave me a lift homeward . I found him much troubl over the disappear of hi littl spaniel . It had wander on to the moor and had never come back . I gave him such consol as I might , but I thought of the poni on the grimpen mire , and I do not fanci that he will see hi littl dog again . “ By the way , mortim , ” said I as we jolt along the rough road , “ I suppos there are few peopl live within drive distanc of thi whom you do not know ? ” “ hardli ani , I think. ” “ can you , then , tell me the name of ani woman whose initi are L. L. ? ” He thought for a few minut . “ No , ” said he . “ there are a few gipsi and labour folk for whom I can ’ t answer , but among the farmer or gentri there is no one whose initi are those . wait a bit though , ” he ad after a paus . “ there is laura lyon -- her initi are L. L. -- but she live in coomb tracey. ” “ who is she ? ” I ask . “ she is frankland ’ s daughter. ” “ what ! old frankland the crank ? ” “ exactli . she marri an artist name lyon , who came sketch on the moor . He prove to be a blackguard and desert her . the fault from what I hear may not have been entir on one side . her father refus to have anyth to do with her becaus she had marri without hi consent and perhap for one or two other reason as well . So , between the old sinner and the young one the girl ha had a pretti bad time. ” “ how doe she live ? ” “ I fanci old frankland allow her a pittanc , but it can not be more , for hi own affair are consider involv . whatev she may have deserv one could not allow her to go hopelessli to the bad . her stori got about , and sever of the peopl here did someth to enabl her to earn an honest live . stapleton did for one , and sir charl for anoth . I gave a trifl myself . It wa to set her up in a typewrit business. ” He want to know the object of my inquiri , but I manag to satisfi hi curios without tell him too much , for there is no reason whi we should take anyon into our confid . tomorrow morn I shall find my way to coomb tracey , and if I can see thi mrs. laura lyon , of equivoc reput , a long step will have been made toward clear one incid in thi chain of mysteri . I am certainli develop the wisdom of the serpent , for when mortim press hi question to an inconveni extent I ask him casual to what type frankland ’ s skull belong , and so heard noth but craniolog for the rest of our drive . I have not live for year with sherlock holm for noth . I have onli one other incid to record upon thi tempestu and melancholi day . thi wa my convers with barrymor just now , which give me one more strong card which I can play in due time . mortim had stay to dinner , and he and the baronet play ecart afterward . the butler brought me my coffe into the librari , and I took the chanc to ask him a few question . “ well , ” said I , “ ha thi preciou relat of your depart , or is he still lurk out yonder ? ” “ I don ’ t know , sir . I hope to heaven that he ha gone , for he ha brought noth but troubl here ! I ’ ve not heard of him sinc I left out food for him last , and that wa three day ago. ” “ did you see him then ? ” “ No , sir , but the food wa gone when next I went that way. ” “ then he wa certainli there ? ” “ So you would think , sir , unless it wa the other man who took it. ” I sat with my coffee-cup halfway to my lip and stare at barrymor . “ you know that there is anoth man then ? ” “ ye , sir ; there is anoth man upon the moor. ” “ have you seen him ? ” “ No , sir. ” “ how do you know of him then ? ” “ selden told me of him , sir , a week ago or more . He ’ s in hide , too , but he ’ s not a convict as far as I can make out . I don ’ t like it , dr. watson -- I tell you straight , sir , that I don ’ t like it. ” He spoke with a sudden passion of earnest . “ now , listen to me , barrymor ! I have no interest in thi matter but that of your master . I have come here with no object except to help him . tell me , frankli , what it is that you don ’ t like. ” barrymor hesit for a moment , as if he regret hi outburst or found it difficult to express hi own feel in word . “ It ’ s all these goings-on , sir , ” he cri at last , wave hi hand toward the rain-lash window which face the moor . “ there ’ s foul play somewher , and there ’ s black villaini brew , to that I ’ ll swear ! veri glad I should be , sir , to see sir henri on hi way back to london again ! ” “ but what is it that alarm you ? ” “ look at sir charl ’ s death ! that wa bad enough , for all that the coron said . look at the nois on the moor at night . there ’ s not a man would cross it after sundown if he wa paid for it . look at thi stranger hide out yonder , and watch and wait ! what ’ s he wait for ? what doe it mean ? It mean no good to anyon of the name of baskervil , and veri glad I shall be to be quit of it all on the day that sir henri ’ s new servant are readi to take over the hall. ” “ but about thi stranger , ” said I . “ can you tell me anyth about him ? what did selden say ? did he find out where he hid , or what he wa do ? ” “ He saw him onc or twice , but he is a deep one and give noth away . At first he thought that he wa the polic , but soon he found that he had some lay of hi own . A kind of gentleman he wa , as far as he could see , but what he wa do he could not make out. ” “ and where did he say that he live ? ” “ among the old hous on the hillsid -- the stone hut where the old folk use to live. ” “ but how about hi food ? ” “ selden found out that he ha got a lad who work for him and bring all he need . I dare say he goe to coomb tracey for what he wants. ” “ veri good , barrymor . We may talk further of thi some other time. ” when the butler had gone I walk over to the black window , and I look through a blur pane at the drive cloud and at the toss outlin of the wind-swept tree . It is a wild night indoor , and what must it be in a stone hut upon the moor . what passion of hatr can it be which lead a man to lurk in such a place at such a time ! and what deep and earnest purpos can he have which call for such a trial ! there , in that hut upon the moor , seem to lie the veri centr of that problem which ha vex me so sore . I swear that anoth day shall not have pass befor I have done all that man can do to reach the heart of the mysteri . chapter 11 . the man on the tor the extract from my privat diari which form the last chapter ha brought my narr up to the eighteenth of octob , a time when these strang event began to move swiftli toward their terribl conclus . the incid of the next few day are indel graven upon my recollect , and I can tell them without refer to the note made at the time . I start them from the day which succeed that upon which I had establish two fact of great import , the one that mrs. laura lyon of coomb tracey had written to sir charl baskervil and made an appoint with him at the veri place and hour that he met hi death , the other that the lurk man upon the moor wa to be found among the stone hut upon the hillsid . with these two fact in my possess I felt that either my intellig or my courag must be defici if I could not throw some further light upon these dark place . I had no opportun to tell the baronet what I had learn about mrs. lyon upon the even befor , for dr. mortim remain with him at card until it wa veri late . At breakfast , howev , I inform him about my discoveri and ask him whether he would care to accompani me to coomb tracey . At first he wa veri eager to come , but on second thought it seem to both of us that if I went alon the result might be better . the more formal we made the visit the less inform we might obtain . I left sir henri behind , therefor , not without some prick of conscienc , and drove off upon my new quest . when I reach coomb tracey I told perkin to put up the hors , and I made inquiri for the ladi whom I had come to interrog . I had no difficulti in find her room , which were central and well appoint . A maid show me in without ceremoni , and as I enter the sitting-room a ladi , who wa sit befor a remington typewrit , sprang up with a pleasant smile of welcom . her face fell , howev , when she saw that I wa a stranger , and she sat down again and ask me the object of my visit . the first impress left by mrs. lyon wa one of extrem beauti . her eye and hair were of the same rich hazel colour , and her cheek , though consider freckl , were flush with the exquisit bloom of the brunett , the dainti pink which lurk at the heart of the sulphur rose . admir wa , I repeat , the first impress . but the second wa critic . there wa someth subtli wrong with the face , some coars of express , some hard , perhap , of eye , some loos of lip which mar it perfect beauti . but these , of cours , are afterthought . At the moment I wa simpli consciou that I wa in the presenc of a veri handsom woman , and that she wa ask me the reason for my visit . I had not quit understood until that instant how delic my mission wa . “ I have the pleasur , ” said I , “ of know your father. ” It wa a clumsi introduct , and the ladi made me feel it . “ there is noth in common between my father and me , ” she said . “ I owe him noth , and hi friend are not mine . If it were not for the late sir charl baskervil and some other kind heart I might have starv for all that my father cared. ” “ It wa about the late sir charl baskervil that I have come here to see you. ” the freckl start out on the ladi ’ s face . “ what can I tell you about him ? ” she ask , and her finger play nervous over the stop of her typewrit . “ you knew him , did you not ? ” “ I have alreadi said that I owe a great deal to hi kind . If I am abl to support myself it is larg due to the interest which he took in my unhappi situation. ” “ did you correspond with him ? ” the ladi look quickli up with an angri gleam in her hazel eye . “ what is the object of these question ? ” she ask sharpli . “ the object is to avoid a public scandal . It is better that I should ask them here than that the matter should pass outsid our control. ” she wa silent and her face wa still veri pale . At last she look up with someth reckless and defiant in her manner . “ well , I ’ ll answer , ” she said . “ what are your question ? ” “ did you correspond with sir charl ? ” “ I certainli wrote to him onc or twice to acknowledg hi delicaci and hi generosity. ” “ have you the date of those letter ? ” “ no. ” “ have you ever met him ? ” “ ye , onc or twice , when he came into coomb tracey . He wa a veri retir man , and he prefer to do good by stealth. ” “ but if you saw him so seldom and wrote so seldom , how did he know enough about your affair to be abl to help you , as you say that he ha done ? ” she met my difficulti with the utmost readi . “ there were sever gentlemen who knew my sad histori and unit to help me . one wa mr. stapleton , a neighbour and intim friend of sir charl ’ s . He wa exceedingli kind , and it wa through him that sir charl learn about my affairs. ” I knew alreadi that sir charl baskervil had made stapleton hi almon upon sever occas , so the ladi ’ s statement bore the impress of truth upon it . “ did you ever write to sir charl ask him to meet you ? ” I continu . mrs. lyon flush with anger again . “ realli , sir , thi is a veri extraordinari question. ” “ I am sorri , madam , but I must repeat it. ” “ then I answer , certainli not. ” “ not on the veri day of sir charl ’ s death ? ” the flush had fade in an instant , and a deathli face wa befor me . her dri lip could not speak the “ No ” which I saw rather than heard . “ sure your memori deceiv you , ” said I . “ I could even quot a passag of your letter . It ran ‘ pleas , pleas , as you are a gentleman , burn thi letter , and be at the gate by ten o ’ clock. ’ ” I thought that she had faint , but she recov herself by a suprem effort . “ Is there no such thing as a gentleman ? ” she gasp . “ you do sir charl an injustic . He did burn the letter . but sometim a letter may be legibl even when burn . you acknowledg now that you wrote it ? ” “ ye , I did write it , ” she cri , pour out her soul in a torrent of word . “ I did write it . whi should I deni it ? I have no reason to be asham of it . I wish him to help me . I believ that if I had an interview I could gain hi help , so I ask him to meet me. ” “ but whi at such an hour ? ” “ becaus I had onli just learn that he wa go to london next day and might be away for month . there were reason whi I could not get there earlier. ” “ but whi a rendezv in the garden instead of a visit to the hous ? ” “ Do you think a woman could go alon at that hour to a bachelor ’ s hous ? ” “ well , what happen when you did get there ? ” “ I never went. ” “ mr . lyon ! ” “ No , I swear it to you on all I hold sacr . I never went . someth interven to prevent my going. ” “ what wa that ? ” “ that is a privat matter . I can not tell it. ” “ you acknowledg then that you made an appoint with sir charl at the veri hour and place at which he met hi death , but you deni that you kept the appointment. ” “ that is the truth. ” again and again I cross-quest her , but I could never get past that point . “ mr . lyon , ” said I as I rose from thi long and inconclus interview , “ you are take a veri great respons and put yourself in a veri fals posit by not make an absolut clean breast of all that you know . If I have to call in the aid of the polic you will find how serious you are compromis . If your posit is innoc , whi did you in the first instanc deni have written to sir charl upon that date ? ” “ becaus I fear that some fals conclus might be drawn from it and that I might find myself involv in a scandal. ” “ and whi were you so press that sir charl should destroy your letter ? ” “ If you have read the letter you will know. ” “ I did not say that I had read all the letter. ” “ you quot some of it. ” “ I quot the postscript . the letter had , as I said , been burn and it wa not all legibl . I ask you onc again whi it wa that you were so press that sir charl should destroy thi letter which he receiv on the day of hi death. ” “ the matter is a veri privat one. ” “ the more reason whi you should avoid a public investigation. ” “ I will tell you , then . If you have heard anyth of my unhappi histori you will know that I made a rash marriag and had reason to regret it. ” “ I have heard so much. ” “ My life ha been one incess persecut from a husband whom I abhor . the law is upon hi side , and everi day I am face by the possibl that he may forc me to live with him . At the time that I wrote thi letter to sir charl I had learn that there wa a prospect of my regain my freedom if certain expens could be met . It meant everyth to me -- peac of mind , happi , self-respect -- everyth . I knew sir charl ’ s generos , and I thought that if he heard the stori from my own lip he would help me. ” “ then how is it that you did not go ? ” “ becaus I receiv help in the interv from anoth source. ” “ whi then , did you not write to sir charl and explain thi ? ” “ So I should have done had I not seen hi death in the paper next morning. ” the woman ’ s stori hung coher togeth , and all my question were unabl to shake it . I could onli check it by find if she had , inde , institut divorc proceed against her husband at or about the time of the tragedi . It wa unlik that she would dare to say that she had not been to baskervil hall if she realli had been , for a trap would be necessari to take her there , and could not have return to coomb tracey until the earli hour of the morn . such an excurs could not be kept secret . the probabl wa , therefor , that she wa tell the truth , or , at least , a part of the truth . I came away baffl and dishearten . onc again I had reach that dead wall which seem to be built across everi path by which I tri to get at the object of my mission . and yet the more I thought of the ladi ’ s face and of her manner the more I felt that someth wa be held back from me . whi should she turn so pale ? whi should she fight against everi admiss until it wa forc from her ? whi should she have been so retic at the time of the tragedi ? sure the explan of all thi could not be as innoc as she would have me believ . for the moment I could proceed no farther in that direct , but must turn back to that other clue which wa to be sought for among the stone hut upon the moor . and that wa a most vagu direct . I realiz it as I drove back and note how hill after hill show trace of the ancient peopl . barrymor ’ s onli indic had been that the stranger live in one of these abandon hut , and mani hundr of them are scatter throughout the length and breadth of the moor . but I had my own experi for a guid sinc it had shown me the man himself stand upon the summit of the black tor . that , then , should be the centr of my search . from there I should explor everi hut upon the moor until I light upon the right one . If thi man were insid it I should find out from hi own lip , at the point of my revolv if necessari , who he wa and whi he had dog us so long . He might slip away from us in the crowd of regent street , but it would puzzl him to do so upon the lone moor . On the other hand , if I should find the hut and it tenant should not be within it I must remain there , howev long the vigil , until he return . holm had miss him in london . It would inde be a triumph for me if I could run him to earth where my master had fail . luck had been against us again and again in thi inquiri , but now at last it came to my aid . and the messeng of good fortun wa none other than mr. frankland , who wa stand , gray-whisk and red-fac , outsid the gate of hi garden , which open on to the highroad along which I travel . “ good-day , dr. watson , ” cri he with unwont good humour , “ you must realli give your hors a rest and come in to have a glass of wine and to congratul me. ” My feel toward him were veri far from be friendli after what I had heard of hi treatment of hi daughter , but I wa anxiou to send perkin and the wagonett home , and the opportun wa a good one . I alight and sent a messag to sir henri that I should walk over in time for dinner . then I follow frankland into hi dining-room . “ It is a great day for me , sir -- one of the red-lett day of my life , ” he cri with mani chuckl . “ I have brought off a doubl event . I mean to teach them in these part that law is law , and that there is a man here who doe not fear to invok it . I have establish a right of way through the centr of old middleton ’ s park , slap across it , sir , within a hundr yard of hi own front door . what do you think of that ? We ’ ll teach these magnat that they can not ride roughshod over the right of the common , confound them ! and I ’ ve close the wood where the fernworthi folk use to picnic . these infern peopl seem to think that there are no right of properti , and that they can swarm where they like with their paper and their bottl . both case decid , dr. watson , and both in my favour . I haven ’ t had such a day sinc I had sir john morland for trespass becaus he shot in hi own warren. ” “ how on earth did you do that ? ” “ look it up in the book , sir . It will repay read -- frankland v. morland , court of queen ’ s bench . It cost me 200 pound , but I got my verdict. ” “ did it do you ani good ? ” “ none , sir , none . I am proud to say that I had no interest in the matter . I act entir from a sens of public duti . I have no doubt , for exampl , that the fernworthi peopl will burn me in effigi tonight . I told the polic last time they did it that they should stop these disgrac exhibit . the counti constabulari is in a scandal state , sir , and it ha not afford me the protect to which I am entitl . the case of frankland v. regina will bring the matter befor the attent of the public . I told them that they would have occas to regret their treatment of me , and alreadi my word have come true. ” “ how so ? ” I ask . the old man put on a veri know express . “ becaus I could tell them what they are die to know ; but noth would induc me to help the rascal in ani way. ” I had been cast round for some excus by which I could get away from hi gossip , but now I began to wish to hear more of it . I had seen enough of the contrari natur of the old sinner to understand that ani strong sign of interest would be the surest way to stop hi confid . “ some poach case , no doubt ? ” said I with an indiffer manner . “ Ha , ha , my boy , a veri much more import matter than that ! what about the convict on the moor ? ” I stare . “ you don ’ t mean that you know where he is ? ” said I . “ I may not know exactli where he is , but I am quit sure that I could help the polic to lay their hand on him . ha it never struck you that the way to catch that man wa to find out where he got hi food and so trace it to him ? ” He certainli seem to be get uncomfort near the truth . “ No doubt , ” said I ; “ but how do you know that he is anywher upon the moor ? ” “ I know it becaus I have seen with my own eye the messeng who take him hi food. ” My heart sank for barrymor . It wa a seriou thing to be in the power of thi spite old busybodi . but hi next remark took a weight from my mind . “ you ’ ll be surpris to hear that hi food is taken to him by a child . I see him everi day through my telescop upon the roof . He pass along the same path at the same hour , and to whom should he be go except to the convict ? ” here wa luck inde ! and yet I suppress all appear of interest . A child ! barrymor had said that our unknown wa suppli by a boy . It wa on hi track , and not upon the convict ’ s , that frankland had stumbl . If I could get hi knowledg it might save me a long and weari hunt . but incredul and indiffer were evid my strongest card . “ I should say that it wa much more like that it wa the son of one of the moorland shepherd take out hi father ’ s dinner. ” the least appear of opposit struck fire out of the old autocrat . hi eye look malignantli at me , and hi gray whisker bristl like those of an angri cat . “ inde , sir ! ” said he , point out over the wide-stretch moor . “ Do you see that black tor over yonder ? well , do you see the low hill beyond with the thornbush upon it ? It is the stoniest part of the whole moor . Is that a place where a shepherd would be like to take hi station ? your suggest , sir , is a most absurd one. ” I meekli answer that I had spoken without know all the fact . My submiss pleas him and led him to further confid . “ you may be sure , sir , that I have veri good ground befor I come to an opinion . I have seen the boy again and again with hi bundl . everi day , and sometim twice a day , I have been abl -- but wait a moment , dr. watson . Do my eye deceiv me , or is there at the present moment someth move upon that hillsid ? ” It wa sever mile off , but I could distinctli see a small dark dot against the dull green and gray . “ come , sir , come ! ” cri frankland , rush upstair . “ you will see with your own eye and judg for yourself. ” the telescop , a formid instrument mount upon a tripod , stood upon the flat lead of the hous . frankland clap hi eye to it and gave a cri of satisfact . “ quick , dr. watson , quick , befor he pass over the hill ! ” there he wa , sure enough , a small urchin with a littl bundl upon hi shoulder , toil slowli up the hill . when he reach the crest I saw the rag uncouth figur outlin for an instant against the cold blue sky . He look round him with a furtiv and stealthi air , as one who dread pursuit . then he vanish over the hill . “ well ! Am I right ? ” “ certainli , there is a boy who seem to have some secret errand. ” “ and what the errand is even a counti constabl could guess . but not one word shall they have from me , and I bind you to secreci also , dr. watson . not a word ! you understand ! ” “ just as you wish. ” “ they have treat me shame -- shame . when the fact come out in frankland v. regina I ventur to think that a thrill of indign will run through the countri . noth would induc me to help the polic in ani way . for all they care it might have been me , instead of my effigi , which these rascal burn at the stake . sure you are not go ! you will help me to empti the decant in honour of thi great occas ! ” but I resist all hi solicit and succeed in dissuad him from hi announc intent of walk home with me . I kept the road as long as hi eye wa on me , and then I struck off across the moor and made for the stoni hill over which the boy had disappear . everyth wa work in my favour , and I swore that it should not be through lack of energi or persever that I should miss the chanc which fortun had thrown in my way . the sun wa alreadi sink when I reach the summit of the hill , and the long slope beneath me were all golden-green on one side and gray shadow on the other . A haze lay low upon the farthest sky-lin , out of which jut the fantast shape of belliv and vixen tor . over the wide expans there wa no sound and no movement . one great gray bird , a gull or curlew , soar aloft in the blue heaven . He and I seem to be the onli live thing between the huge arch of the sky and the desert beneath it . the barren scene , the sens of loneli , and the mysteri and urgenc of my task all struck a chill into my heart . the boy wa nowher to be seen . but down beneath me in a cleft of the hill there wa a circl of the old stone hut , and in the middl of them there wa one which retain suffici roof to act as a screen against the weather . My heart leap within me as I saw it . thi must be the burrow where the stranger lurk . At last my foot wa on the threshold of hi hide place -- hi secret wa within my grasp . As I approach the hut , walk as warili as stapleton would do when with pois net he drew near the settl butterfli , I satisfi myself that the place had inde been use as a habit . A vagu pathway among the boulder led to the dilapid open which serv as a door . all wa silent within . the unknown might be lurk there , or he might be prowl on the moor . My nerv tingl with the sens of adventur . throw asid my cigarett , I close my hand upon the butt of my revolv and , walk swiftli up to the door , I look in . the place wa empti . but there were ampl sign that I had not come upon a fals scent . thi wa certainli where the man live . some blanket roll in a waterproof lay upon that veri stone slab upon which neolith man had onc slumber . the ash of a fire were heap in a rude grate . besid it lay some cook utensil and a bucket half-ful of water . A litter of empti tin show that the place had been occupi for some time , and I saw , as my eye becam accustom to the checker light , a pannikin and a half-ful bottl of spirit stand in the corner . In the middl of the hut a flat stone serv the purpos of a tabl , and upon thi stood a small cloth bundl -- the same , no doubt , which I had seen through the telescop upon the shoulder of the boy . It contain a loaf of bread , a tin tongu , and two tin of preserv peach . As I set it down again , after have examin it , my heart leap to see that beneath it there lay a sheet of paper with write upon it . I rais it , and thi wa what I read , roughli scrawl in pencil : “ Dr . watson ha gone to coomb tracey. ” for a minut I stood there with the paper in my hand think out the mean of thi curt messag . It wa I , then , and not sir henri , who wa be dog by thi secret man . He had not follow me himself , but he had set an agent -- the boy , perhap -- upon my track , and thi wa hi report . possibl I had taken no step sinc I had been upon the moor which had not been observ and report . alway there wa thi feel of an unseen forc , a fine net drawn round us with infinit skill and delicaci , hold us so lightli that it wa onli at some suprem moment that one realiz that one wa inde entangl in it mesh . If there wa one report there might be other , so I look round the hut in search of them . there wa no trace , howev , of anyth of the kind , nor could I discov ani sign which might indic the charact or intent of the man who live in thi singular place , save that he must be of spartan habit and care littl for the comfort of life . when I thought of the heavi rain and look at the gape roof I understood how strong and immut must be the purpos which had kept him in that inhospit abod . wa he our malign enemi , or wa he by chanc our guardian angel ? I swore that I would not leav the hut until I knew . outsid the sun wa sink low and the west wa blaze with scarlet and gold . it reflect wa shot back in ruddi patch by the distant pool which lay amid the great grimpen mire . there were the two tower of baskervil hall , and there a distant blur of smoke which mark the villag of grimpen . between the two , behind the hill , wa the hous of the stapleton . all wa sweet and mellow and peac in the golden even light , and yet as I look at them my soul share none of the peac of natur but quiver at the vagu and the terror of that interview which everi instant wa bring nearer . with tingl nerv but a fix purpos , I sat in the dark recess of the hut and wait with sombr patienc for the come of it tenant . and then at last I heard him . far away came the sharp clink of a boot strike upon a stone . then anoth and yet anoth , come nearer and nearer . I shrank back into the darkest corner and cock the pistol in my pocket , determin not to discov myself until I had an opportun of see someth of the stranger . there wa a long paus which show that he had stop . then onc more the footstep approach and a shadow fell across the open of the hut . “ It is a love even , my dear watson , ” said a well-known voic . “ I realli think that you will be more comfort outsid than in. ” chapter 12 . death on the moor for a moment or two I sat breathless , hardli abl to believ my ear . then my sens and my voic came back to me , while a crush weight of respons seem in an instant to be lift from my soul . that cold , incis , iron voic could belong to but one man in all the world . “ holm ! ” I cri -- “ holm ! ” “ come out , ” said he , “ and pleas be care with the revolver. ” I stoop under the rude lintel , and there he sat upon a stone outsid , hi gray eye danc with amus as they fell upon my astonish featur . He wa thin and worn , but clear and alert , hi keen face bronz by the sun and roughen by the wind . In hi tweed suit and cloth cap he look like ani other tourist upon the moor , and he had contriv , with that catlik love of person cleanli which wa one of hi characterist , that hi chin should be as smooth and hi linen as perfect as if he were in baker street . “ I never wa more glad to see anyon in my life , ” said I as I wrung him by the hand . “ Or more astonish , eh ? ” “ well , I must confess to it. ” “ the surpris wa not all on one side , I assur you . I had no idea that you had found my occasion retreat , still less that you were insid it , until I wa within twenti pace of the door. ” “ My footprint , I presum ? ” “ No , watson , I fear that I could not undertak to recogn your footprint amid all the footprint of the world . If you serious desir to deceiv me you must chang your tobacconist ; for when I see the stub of a cigarett mark bradley , oxford street , I know that my friend watson is in the neighbourhood . you will see it there besid the path . you threw it down , no doubt , at that suprem moment when you charg into the empti hut. ” “ exactly. ” “ I thought as much -- and know your admir tenac I wa convinc that you were sit in ambush , a weapon within reach , wait for the tenant to return . So you actual thought that I wa the crimin ? ” “ I did not know who you were , but I wa determin to find out. ” “ excel , watson ! and how did you local me ? you saw me , perhap , on the night of the convict hunt , when I wa so imprud as to allow the moon to rise behind me ? ” “ ye , I saw you then. ” “ and have no doubt search all the hut until you came to thi one ? ” “ No , your boy had been observ , and that gave me a guid where to look. ” “ the old gentleman with the telescop , no doubt . I could not make it out when first I saw the light flash upon the lens. ” He rose and peep into the hut . “ Ha , I see that cartwright ha brought up some suppli . what ’ s thi paper ? So you have been to coomb tracey , have you ? ” “ yes. ” “ To see mrs. laura lyon ? ” “ exactly. ” “ well done ! our research have evid been run on parallel line , and when we unit our result I expect we shall have a fairli full knowledg of the case. ” “ well , I am glad from my heart that you are here , for inde the respons and the mysteri were both becom too much for my nerv . but how in the name of wonder did you come here , and what have you been do ? I thought that you were in baker street work out that case of blackmailing. ” “ that wa what I wish you to think. ” “ then you use me , and yet do not trust me ! ” I cri with some bitter . “ I think that I have deserv better at your hand , holmes. ” “ My dear fellow , you have been invalu to me in thi as in mani other case , and I beg that you will forgiv me if I have seem to play a trick upon you . In truth , it wa partli for your own sake that I did it , and it wa my appreci of the danger which you ran which led me to come down and examin the matter for myself . had I been with sir henri and you it is confid that my point of view would have been the same as your , and my presenc would have warn our veri formid oppon to be on their guard . As it is , I have been abl to get about as I could not possibl have done had I been live in the hall , and I remain an unknown factor in the busi , readi to throw in all my weight at a critic moment. ” “ but whi keep me in the dark ? ” “ for you to know could not have help us and might possibl have led to my discoveri . you would have wish to tell me someth , or in your kind you would have brought me out some comfort or other , and so an unnecessari risk would be run . I brought cartwright down with me -- you rememb the littl chap at the express offic -- and he ha seen after my simpl want : a loaf of bread and a clean collar . what doe man want more ? He ha given me an extra pair of eye upon a veri activ pair of feet , and both have been invaluable. ” “ then my report have all been wast ! ” -- My voic trembl as I recal the pain and the pride with which I had compos them . holm took a bundl of paper from hi pocket . “ here are your report , my dear fellow , and veri well thumb , I assur you . I made excel arrang , and they are onli delay one day upon their way . I must compliment you exceedingli upon the zeal and the intellig which you have shown over an extraordinarili difficult case. ” I wa still rather raw over the decept which had been practis upon me , but the warmth of holm ’ s prais drove my anger from my mind . I felt also in my heart that he wa right in what he said and that it wa realli best for our purpos that I should not have known that he wa upon the moor . “ that ’ s better , ” said he , see the shadow rise from my face . “ and now tell me the result of your visit to mrs. laura lyon -- it wa not difficult for me to guess that it wa to see her that you had gone , for I am alreadi awar that she is the one person in coomb tracey who might be of servic to us in the matter . In fact , if you had not gone today it is exceedingli probabl that I should have gone tomorrow. ” the sun had set and dusk wa settl over the moor . the air had turn chill and we withdrew into the hut for warmth . there , sit togeth in the twilight , I told holm of my convers with the ladi . So interest wa he that I had to repeat some of it twice befor he wa satisfi . “ thi is most import , ” said he when I had conclud . “ It fill up a gap which I had been unabl to bridg in thi most complex affair . you are awar , perhap , that a close intimaci exist between thi ladi and the man stapleton ? ” “ I did not know of a close intimacy. ” “ there can be no doubt about the matter . they meet , they write , there is a complet understand between them . now , thi put a veri power weapon into our hand . If I could onli use it to detach hi wife -- ” “ hi wife ? ” “ I am give you some inform now , in return for all that you have given me . the ladi who ha pass here as miss stapleton is in realiti hi wife. ” “ good heaven , holm ! are you sure of what you say ? how could he have permit sir henri to fall in love with her ? ” “ sir henri ’ s fall in love could do no harm to anyon except sir henri . He took particular care that sir henri did not make love to her , as you have yourself observ . I repeat that the ladi is hi wife and not hi sister. ” “ but whi thi elabor decept ? ” “ becaus he foresaw that she would be veri much more use to him in the charact of a free woman. ” all my unspoken instinct , my vagu suspicion , suddenli took shape and centr upon the naturalist . In that impass colourless man , with hi straw hat and hi butterfly-net , I seem to see someth terribl -- a creatur of infinit patienc and craft , with a smile face and a murder heart . “ It is he , then , who is our enemi -- it is he who dog us in london ? ” “ So I read the riddle. ” “ and the warn -- it must have come from her ! ” “ exactly. ” the shape of some monstrou villaini , half seen , half guess , loom through the dark which had girt me so long . “ but are you sure of thi , holm ? how do you know that the woman is hi wife ? ” “ becaus he so far forgot himself as to tell you a true piec of autobiographi upon the occas when he first met you , and I dare say he ha mani a time regret it sinc . He wa onc a schoolmast in the north of england . now , there is no one more easi to trace than a schoolmast . there are scholast agenc by which one may identifi ani man who ha been in the profess . A littl investig show me that a school had come to grief under atroci circumst , and that the man who had own it -- the name wa differ -- had disappear with hi wife . the descript agre . when I learn that the miss man wa devot to entomolog the identif wa complete. ” the dark wa rise , but much wa still hidden by the shadow . “ If thi woman is in truth hi wife , where doe mrs. laura lyon come in ? ” I ask . “ that is one of the point upon which your own research have shed a light . your interview with the ladi ha clear the situat veri much . I did not know about a project divorc between herself and her husband . In that case , regard stapleton as an unmarri man , she count no doubt upon becom hi wife. ” “ and when she is undeceiv ? ” “ whi , then we may find the ladi of servic . It must be our first duti to see her -- both of us -- tomorrow . don ’ t you think , watson , that you are away from your charg rather long ? your place should be at baskervil hall. ” the last red streak had fade away in the west and night had settl upon the moor . A few faint star were gleam in a violet sky . “ one last question , holm , ” I said as I rose . “ sure there is no need of secreci between you and me . what is the mean of it all ? what is he after ? ” holm ’ s voic sank as he answer : “ It is murder , watson -- refin , cold-blood , deliber murder . Do not ask me for particular . My net are close upon him , even as hi are upon sir henri , and with your help he is alreadi almost at my merci . there is but one danger which can threaten us . It is that he should strike befor we are readi to do so . anoth day -- two at the most -- and I have my case complet , but until then guard your charg as close as ever a fond mother watch her ail child . your mission today ha justifi itself , and yet I could almost wish that you had not left hi side . hark ! ” A terribl scream -- a prolong yell of horror and anguish -- burst out of the silenc of the moor . that fright cri turn the blood to ice in my vein . “ Oh , my god ! ” I gasp . “ what is it ? what doe it mean ? ” holm had sprung to hi feet , and I saw hi dark , athlet outlin at the door of the hut , hi shoulder stoop , hi head thrust forward , hi face peer into the dark . “ hush ! ” he whisper . “ hush ! ” the cri had been loud on account of it vehem , but it had peal out from somewher far off on the shadowi plain . now it burst upon our ear , nearer , louder , more urgent than befor . “ where is it ? ” holm whisper ; and I knew from the thrill of hi voic that he , the man of iron , wa shaken to the soul . “ where is it , watson ? ” “ there , I think. ” I point into the dark . “ No , there ! ” again the agon cri swept through the silent night , louder and much nearer than ever . and a new sound mingl with it , a deep , mutter rumbl , music and yet menac , rise and fall like the low , constant murmur of the sea . “ the hound ! ” cri holm . “ come , watson , come ! great heaven , if we are too late ! ” He had start run swiftli over the moor , and I had follow at hi heel . but now from somewher among the broken ground immedi in front of us there came one last despair yell , and then a dull , heavi thud . We halt and listen . not anoth sound broke the heavi silenc of the windless night . I saw holm put hi hand to hi forehead like a man distract . He stamp hi feet upon the ground . “ He ha beaten us , watson . We are too late. ” “ No , no , sure not ! ” “ fool that I wa to hold my hand . and you , watson , see what come of abandon your charg ! but , by heaven , if the worst ha happen we ’ ll aveng him ! ” blindli we ran through the gloom , blunder against boulder , forc our way through gors bush , pant up hill and rush down slope , head alway in the direct whenc those dread sound had come . At everi rise holm look eagerli round him , but the shadow were thick upon the moor , and noth move upon it dreari face . “ can you see anyth ? ” “ nothing. ” “ but , hark , what is that ? ” A low moan had fallen upon our ear . there it wa again upon our left ! On that side a ridg of rock end in a sheer cliff which overlook a stone-strewn slope . On it jag face wa spread-eagl some dark , irregular object . As we ran toward it the vagu outlin harden into a definit shape . It wa a prostrat man face downward upon the ground , the head doubl under him at a horribl angl , the shoulder round and the bodi hunch togeth as if in the act of throw a somersault . So grotesqu wa the attitud that I could not for the instant realiz that that moan had been the pass of hi soul . not a whisper , not a rustl , rose now from the dark figur over which we stoop . holm laid hi hand upon him and held it up again with an exclam of horror . the gleam of the match which he struck shone upon hi clot finger and upon the ghastli pool which widen slowli from the crush skull of the victim . and it shone upon someth els which turn our heart sick and faint within us -- the bodi of sir henri baskervil ! there wa no chanc of either of us forget that peculiar ruddi tweed suit -- the veri one which he had worn on the first morn that we had seen him in baker street . We caught the one clear glimps of it , and then the match flicker and went out , even as the hope had gone out of our soul . holm groan , and hi face glimmer white through the dark . “ the brute ! the brute ! ” I cri with clench hand . “ Oh holm , I shall never forgiv myself for have left him to hi fate. ” “ I am more to blame than you , watson . In order to have my case well round and complet , I have thrown away the life of my client . It is the greatest blow which ha befallen me in my career . but how could I know -- how could I know -- that he would risk hi life alon upon the moor in the face of all my warn ? ” “ that we should have heard hi scream -- my god , those scream ! -- and yet have been unabl to save him ! where is thi brute of a hound which drove him to hi death ? It may be lurk among these rock at thi instant . and stapleton , where is he ? He shall answer for thi deed. ” “ He shall . I will see to that . uncl and nephew have been murder -- the one frighten to death by the veri sight of a beast which he thought to be supernatur , the other driven to hi end in hi wild flight to escap from it . but now we have to prove the connect between the man and the beast . save from what we heard , we can not even swear to the exist of the latter , sinc sir henri ha evid die from the fall . but , by heaven , cun as he is , the fellow shall be in my power befor anoth day is past ! ” We stood with bitter heart on either side of the mangl bodi , overwhelm by thi sudden and irrevoc disast which had brought all our long and weari labour to so piteou an end . then as the moon rose we climb to the top of the rock over which our poor friend had fallen , and from the summit we gaze out over the shadowi moor , half silver and half gloom . far away , mile off , in the direct of grimpen , a singl steadi yellow light wa shine . It could onli come from the lone abod of the stapleton . with a bitter curs I shook my fist at it as I gaze . “ whi should we not seiz him at onc ? ” “ our case is not complet . the fellow is wari and cun to the last degre . It is not what we know , but what we can prove . If we make one fals move the villain may escap us yet. ” “ what can we do ? ” “ there will be plenti for us to do tomorrow . tonight we can onli perform the last offic to our poor friend. ” togeth we made our way down the precipit slope and approach the bodi , black and clear against the silver stone . the agoni of those contort limb struck me with a spasm of pain and blur my eye with tear . “ We must send for help , holm ! We can not carri him all the way to the hall . good heaven , are you mad ? ” He had utter a cri and bent over the bodi . now he wa danc and laugh and wring my hand . could thi be my stern , self-contain friend ? these were hidden fire , inde ! “ A beard ! A beard ! the man ha a beard ! ” “ A beard ? ” “ It is not the baronet -- it is -- whi , it is my neighbour , the convict ! ” with feverish hast we had turn the bodi over , and that drip beard wa point up to the cold , clear moon . there could be no doubt about the beetl forehead , the sunken anim eye . It wa inde the same face which had glare upon me in the light of the candl from over the rock -- the face of selden , the crimin . then in an instant it wa all clear to me . I rememb how the baronet had told me that he had hand hi old wardrob to barrymor . barrymor had pass it on in order to help selden in hi escap . boot , shirt , cap -- it wa all sir henri ’ s . the tragedi wa still black enough , but thi man had at least deserv death by the law of hi countri . I told holm how the matter stood , my heart bubbl over with thank and joy . “ then the cloth have been the poor devil ’ s death , ” said he . “ It is clear enough that the hound ha been laid on from some articl of sir henri ’ s -- the boot which wa abstract in the hotel , in all probabl -- and so ran thi man down . there is one veri singular thing , howev : how came selden , in the dark , to know that the hound wa on hi trail ? ” “ He heard him. ” “ To hear a hound upon the moor would not work a hard man like thi convict into such a paroxysm of terror that he would risk recaptur by scream wildli for help . By hi cri he must have run a long way after he knew the anim wa on hi track . how did he know ? ” “ A greater mysteri to me is whi thi hound , presum that all our conjectur are correct -- ” “ I presum nothing. ” “ well , then , whi thi hound should be loos tonight . I suppos that it doe not alway run loos upon the moor . stapleton would not let it go unless he had reason to think that sir henri would be there. ” “ My difficulti is the more formid of the two , for I think that we shall veri shortli get an explan of your , while mine may remain forev a mysteri . the question now is , what shall we do with thi poor wretch ’ s bodi ? We can not leav it here to the fox and the ravens. ” “ I suggest that we put it in one of the hut until we can commun with the police. ” “ exactli . I have no doubt that you and I could carri it so far . halloa , watson , what ’ s thi ? It ’ s the man himself , by all that ’ s wonder and audaci ! not a word to show your suspicion -- not a word , or my plan crumbl to the ground. ” A figur wa approach us over the moor , and I saw the dull red glow of a cigar . the moon shone upon him , and I could distinguish the dapper shape and jaunti walk of the naturalist . He stop when he saw us , and then came on again . “ whi , dr. watson , that ’ s not you , is it ? you are the last man that I should have expect to see out on the moor at thi time of night . but , dear me , what ’ s thi ? somebodi hurt ? not -- don ’ t tell me that it is our friend sir henri ! ” He hurri past me and stoop over the dead man . I heard a sharp intak of hi breath and the cigar fell from hi finger . “ who -- who ’ s thi ? ” he stammer . “ It is selden , the man who escap from princetown. ” stapleton turn a ghastli face upon us , but by a suprem effort he had overcom hi amaz and hi disappoint . He look sharpli from holm to me . “ dear me ! what a veri shock affair ! how did he die ? ” “ He appear to have broken hi neck by fall over these rock . My friend and I were stroll on the moor when we heard a cry. ” “ I heard a cri also . that wa what brought me out . I wa uneasi about sir henry. ” “ whi about sir henri in particular ? ” I could not help ask . “ becaus I had suggest that he should come over . when he did not come I wa surpris , and I natur becam alarm for hi safeti when I heard cri upon the moor . By the way ” -- hi eye dart again from my face to holm ’ s -- “ did you hear anyth els besid a cri ? ” “ No , ” said holm ; “ did you ? ” “ no. ” “ what do you mean , then ? ” “ Oh , you know the stori that the peasant tell about a phantom hound , and so on . It is said to be heard at night upon the moor . I wa wonder if there were ani evid of such a sound tonight. ” “ We heard noth of the kind , ” said I . “ and what is your theori of thi poor fellow ’ s death ? ” “ I have no doubt that anxieti and exposur have driven him off hi head . He ha rush about the moor in a crazi state and eventu fallen over here and broken hi neck. ” “ that seem the most reason theori , ” said stapleton , and he gave a sigh which I took to indic hi relief . “ what do you think about it , mr. sherlock holm ? ” My friend bow hi compliment . “ you are quick at identif , ” said he . “ We have been expect you in these part sinc dr. watson came down . you are in time to see a tragedy. ” “ ye , inde . I have no doubt that my friend ’ s explan will cover the fact . I will take an unpleas remembr back to london with me tomorrow. ” “ Oh , you return tomorrow ? ” “ that is my intention. ” “ I hope your visit ha cast some light upon those occurr which have puzzl us ? ” holm shrug hi shoulder . “ one can not alway have the success for which one hope . An investig need fact and not legend or rumour . It ha not been a satisfactori case. ” My friend spoke in hi frankest and most unconcern manner . stapleton still look hard at him . then he turn to me . “ I would suggest carri thi poor fellow to my hous , but it would give my sister such a fright that I do not feel justifi in do it . I think that if we put someth over hi face he will be safe until morning. ” and so it wa arrang . resist stapleton ’ s offer of hospit , holm and I set off to baskervil hall , leav the naturalist to return alon . look back we saw the figur move slowli away over the broad moor , and behind him that one black smudg on the silver slope which show where the man wa lie who had come so horribl to hi end . chapter 13 . fix the net “ We ’ re at close grip at last , ” said holm as we walk togeth across the moor . “ what a nerv the fellow ha ! how he pull himself togeth in the face of what must have been a paralyz shock when he found that the wrong man had fallen a victim to hi plot . I told you in london , watson , and I tell you now again , that we have never had a foeman more worthi of our steel. ” “ I am sorri that he ha seen you. ” “ and so wa I at first . but there wa no get out of it. ” “ what effect do you think it will have upon hi plan now that he know you are here ? ” “ It may caus him to be more cautiou , or it may drive him to desper measur at onc . like most clever crimin , he may be too confid in hi own clever and imagin that he ha complet deceiv us. ” “ whi should we not arrest him at onc ? ” “ My dear watson , you were born to be a man of action . your instinct is alway to do someth energet . but suppos , for argument ’ s sake , that we had him arrest tonight , what on earth the better off should we be for that ? We could prove noth against him . there ’ s the devilish cun of it ! If he were act through a human agent we could get some evid , but if we were to drag thi great dog to the light of day it would not help us in put a rope round the neck of it master. ” “ sure we have a case. ” “ not a shadow of one -- onli surmis and conjectur . We should be laugh out of court if we came with such a stori and such evidence. ” “ there is sir charl ’ s death. ” “ found dead without a mark upon him . you and I know that he die of sheer fright , and we know also what frighten him , but how are we to get twelv stolid jurymen to know it ? what sign are there of a hound ? where are the mark of it fang ? Of cours we know that a hound doe not bite a dead bodi and that sir charl wa dead befor ever the brute overtook him . but we have to prove all thi , and we are not in a posit to do it. ” “ well , then , tonight ? ” “ We are not much better off tonight . again , there wa no direct connect between the hound and the man ’ s death . We never saw the hound . We heard it , but we could not prove that it wa run upon thi man ’ s trail . there is a complet absenc of motiv . No , my dear fellow ; we must reconcil ourselv to the fact that we have no case at present , and that it is worth our while to run ani risk in order to establish one. ” “ and how do you propos to do so ? ” “ I have great hope of what mrs. laura lyon may do for us when the posit of affair is made clear to her . and I have my own plan as well . suffici for tomorrow is the evil thereof ; but I hope befor the day is past to have the upper hand at last. ” I could draw noth further from him , and he walk , lost in thought , as far as the baskervil gate . “ are you come up ? ” “ ye ; I see no reason for further conceal . but one last word , watson . say noth of the hound to sir henri . let him think that selden ’ s death wa as stapleton would have us believ . He will have a better nerv for the ordeal which he will have to undergo tomorrow , when he is engag , if I rememb your report aright , to dine with these people. ” “ and so am I. ” “ then you must excus yourself and he must go alon . that will be easili arrang . and now , if we are too late for dinner , I think that we are both readi for our suppers. ” sir henri wa more pleas than surpris to see sherlock holm , for he had for some day been expect that recent event would bring him down from london . He did rais hi eyebrow , howev , when he found that my friend had neither ani luggag nor ani explan for it absenc . between us we soon suppli hi want , and then over a belat supper we explain to the baronet as much of our experi as it seem desir that he should know . but first I had the unpleas duti of break the news to barrymor and hi wife . To him it may have been an unmitig relief , but she wept bitterli in her apron . To all the world he wa the man of violenc , half anim and half demon ; but to her he alway remain the littl wil boy of her own girlhood , the child who had clung to her hand . evil inde is the man who ha not one woman to mourn him . “ I ’ ve been mope in the hous all day sinc watson went off in the morn , ” said the baronet . “ I guess I should have some credit , for I have kept my promis . If I hadn ’ t sworn not to go about alon I might have had a more live even , for I had a messag from stapleton ask me over there. ” “ I have no doubt that you would have had a more live even , ” said holm drili . “ By the way , I don ’ t suppos you appreci that we have been mourn over you as have broken your neck ? ” sir henri open hi eye . “ how wa that ? ” “ thi poor wretch wa dress in your cloth . I fear your servant who gave them to him may get into troubl with the police. ” “ that is unlik . there wa no mark on ani of them , as far as I know. ” “ that ’ s lucki for him -- in fact , it ’ s lucki for all of you , sinc you are all on the wrong side of the law in thi matter . I am not sure that as a conscienti detect my first duti is not to arrest the whole household . watson ’ s report are most incrimin documents. ” “ but how about the case ? ” ask the baronet . “ have you made anyth out of the tangl ? I don ’ t know that watson and I are much the wiser sinc we came down. ” “ I think that I shall be in a posit to make the situat rather more clear to you befor long . It ha been an exceedingli difficult and most complic busi . there are sever point upon which we still want light -- but it is come all the same. ” “ We ’ ve had one experi , as watson ha no doubt told you . We heard the hound on the moor , so I can swear that it is not all empti superstit . I had someth to do with dog when I wa out west , and I know one when I hear one . If you can muzzl that one and put him on a chain I ’ ll be readi to swear you are the greatest detect of all time. ” “ I think I will muzzl him and chain him all right if you will give me your help. ” “ whatev you tell me to do I will do. ” “ veri good ; and I will ask you also to do it blindli , without alway ask the reason. ” “ just as you like. ” “ If you will do thi I think the chanc are that our littl problem will soon be solv . I have no doubt -- ” He stop suddenli and stare fixedli up over my head into the air . the lamp beat upon hi face , and so intent wa it and so still that it might have been that of a clear-cut classic statu , a personif of alert and expect . “ what is it ? ” we both cri . I could see as he look down that he wa repress some intern emot . hi featur were still compos , but hi eye shone with amus exult . “ excus the admir of a connoisseur , ” said he as he wave hi hand toward the line of portrait which cover the opposit wall . “ watson won ’ t allow that I know anyth of art but that is mere jealousi becaus our view upon the subject differ . now , these are a realli veri fine seri of portraits. ” “ well , I ’ m glad to hear you say so , ” said sir henri , glanc with some surpris at my friend . “ I don ’ t pretend to know much about these thing , and I ’ d be a better judg of a hors or a steer than of a pictur . I didn ’ t know that you found time for such things. ” “ I know what is good when I see it , and I see it now . that ’ s a kneller , I ’ ll swear , that ladi in the blue silk over yonder , and the stout gentleman with the wig ought to be a reynold . they are all famili portrait , I presum ? ” “ everi one. ” “ Do you know the name ? ” “ barrymor ha been coach me in them , and I think I can say my lesson fairli well. ” “ who is the gentleman with the telescop ? ” “ that is rear-admir baskervil , who serv under rodney in the west indi . the man with the blue coat and the roll of paper is sir william baskervil , who wa chairman of committe of the hous of common under pitt. ” “ and thi cavali opposit to me -- the one with the black velvet and the lace ? ” “ Ah , you have a right to know about him . that is the caus of all the mischief , the wick hugo , who start the hound of the baskervil . We ’ re not like to forget him. ” I gaze with interest and some surpris upon the portrait . “ dear me ! ” said holm , “ he seem a quiet , meek-mann man enough , but I dare say that there wa a lurk devil in hi eye . I had pictur him as a more robust and ruffianli person. ” “ there ’ s no doubt about the authent , for the name and the date , 1647 , are on the back of the canvas. ” holm said littl more , but the pictur of the old royster seem to have a fascin for him , and hi eye were continu fix upon it dure supper . It wa not until later , when sir henri had gone to hi room , that I wa abl to follow the trend of hi thought . He led me back into the banqueting-hal , hi bedroom candl in hi hand , and he held it up against the time-stain portrait on the wall . “ Do you see anyth there ? ” I look at the broad plume hat , the curl love-lock , the white lace collar , and the straight , sever face which wa frame between them . It wa not a brutal counten , but it wa prim , hard , and stern , with a firm-set , thin-lip mouth , and a coldli intoler eye . “ Is it like anyon you know ? ” “ there is someth of sir henri about the jaw. ” “ just a suggest , perhap . but wait an instant ! ” He stood upon a chair , and , hold up the light in hi left hand , he curv hi right arm over the broad hat and round the long ringlet . “ good heaven ! ” I cri in amaz . the face of stapleton had sprung out of the canva . “ Ha , you see it now . My eye have been train to examin face and not their trim . It is the first qualiti of a crimin investig that he should see through a disguise. ” “ but thi is marvel . It might be hi portrait. ” “ ye , it is an interest instanc of a throwback , which appear to be both physic and spiritu . A studi of famili portrait is enough to convert a man to the doctrin of reincarn . the fellow is a baskervil -- that is evident. ” “ with design upon the succession. ” “ exactli . thi chanc of the pictur ha suppli us with one of our most obviou miss link . We have him , watson , we have him , and I dare swear that befor tomorrow night he will be flutter in our net as helpless as one of hi own butterfli . A pin , a cork , and a card , and we add him to the baker street collect ! ” He burst into one of hi rare fit of laughter as he turn away from the pictur . I have not heard him laugh often , and it ha alway bode ill to somebodi . I wa up betim in the morn , but holm wa afoot earlier still , for I saw him as I dress , come up the drive . “ ye , we should have a full day today , ” he remark , and he rub hi hand with the joy of action . “ the net are all in place , and the drag is about to begin . We ’ ll know befor the day is out whether we have caught our big , leanjaw pike , or whether he ha got through the meshes. ” “ have you been on the moor alreadi ? ” “ I have sent a report from grimpen to princetown as to the death of selden . I think I can promis that none of you will be troubl in the matter . and I have also commun with my faith cartwright , who would certainli have pine away at the door of my hut , as a dog doe at hi master ’ s grave , if I had not set hi mind at rest about my safety. ” “ what is the next move ? ” “ To see sir henri . Ah , here he is ! ” “ good-morn , holm , ” said the baronet . “ you look like a gener who is plan a battl with hi chief of the staff. ” “ that is the exact situat . watson wa ask for orders. ” “ and so do I. ” “ veri good . you are engag , as I understand , to dine with our friend the stapleton tonight. ” “ I hope that you will come also . they are veri hospit peopl , and I am sure that they would be veri glad to see you. ” “ I fear that watson and I must go to london. ” “ To london ? ” “ ye , I think that we should be more use there at the present juncture. ” the baronet ’ s face percept lengthen . “ I hope that you were go to see me through thi busi . the hall and the moor are not veri pleasant place when one is alone. ” “ My dear fellow , you must trust me implicitli and do exactli what I tell you . you can tell your friend that we should have been happi to have come with you , but that urgent busi requir us to be in town . We hope veri soon to return to devonshir . will you rememb to give them that messag ? ” “ If you insist upon it. ” “ there is no altern , I assur you. ” I saw by the baronet ’ s cloud brow that he wa deepli hurt by what he regard as our desert . “ when do you desir to go ? ” he ask coldli . “ immedi after breakfast . We will drive in to coomb tracey , but watson will leav hi thing as a pledg that he will come back to you . watson , you will send a note to stapleton to tell him that you regret that you can not come. ” “ I have a good mind to go to london with you , ” said the baronet . “ whi should I stay here alon ? ” “ becaus it is your post of duti . becaus you gave me your word that you would do as you were told , and I tell you to stay. ” “ all right , then , I ’ ll stay. ” “ one more direct ! I wish you to drive to merripit hous . send back your trap , howev , and let them know that you intend to walk home. ” “ To walk across the moor ? ” “ yes. ” “ but that is the veri thing which you have so often caution me not to do. ” “ thi time you may do it with safeti . If I had not everi confid in your nerv and courag I would not suggest it , but it is essenti that you should do it. ” “ then I will do it. ” “ and as you valu your life do not go across the moor in ani direct save along the straight path which lead from merripit hous to the grimpen road , and is your natur way home. ” “ I will do just what you say. ” “ veri good . I should be glad to get away as soon after breakfast as possibl , so as to reach london in the afternoon. ” I wa much astound by thi programm , though I rememb that holm had said to stapleton on the night befor that hi visit would termin next day . It had not cross my mind howev , that he would wish me to go with him , nor could I understand how we could both be absent at a moment which he himself declar to be critic . there wa noth for it , howev , but implicit obedi ; so we bade good-by to our rueful friend , and a coupl of hour afterward we were at the station of coomb tracey and had dispatch the trap upon it return journey . A small boy wa wait upon the platform . “ ani order , sir ? ” “ you will take thi train to town , cartwright . the moment you arriv you will send a wire to sir henri baskervil , in my name , to say that if he find the pocketbook which I have drop he is to send it by regist post to baker street. ” “ ye , sir. ” “ and ask at the station offic if there is a messag for me. ” the boy return with a telegram , which holm hand to me . It ran : wire receiv . come down with unsign warrant . arriv five-forti . lestrad . “ that is in answer to mine of thi morn . He is the best of the profession , I think , and we may need hi assist . now , watson , I think that we can not employ our time better than by call upon your acquaint , mrs. laura lyons. ” hi plan of campaign wa begin to be evid . He would use the baronet in order to convinc the stapleton that we were realli gone , while we should actual return at the instant when we were like to be need . that telegram from london , if mention by sir henri to the stapleton , must remov the last suspicion from their mind . alreadi I seem to see our net draw closer around that leanjaw pike . mrs. laura lyon wa in her offic , and sherlock holm open hi interview with a frank and direct which consider amaz her . “ I am investig the circumst which attend the death of the late sir charl baskervil , ” said he . “ My friend here , dr. watson , ha inform me of what you have commun , and also of what you have withheld in connect with that matter. ” “ what have I withheld ? ” she ask defiantli . “ you have confess that you ask sir charl to be at the gate at ten o ’ clock . We know that that wa the place and hour of hi death . you have withheld what the connect is between these events. ” “ there is no connection. ” “ In that case the coincid must inde be an extraordinari one . but I think that we shall succeed in establish a connect , after all . I wish to be perfectli frank with you , mrs. lyon . We regard thi case as one of murder , and the evid may implic not onli your friend mr. stapleton but hi wife as well. ” the ladi sprang from her chair . “ hi wife ! ” she cri . “ the fact is no longer a secret . the person who ha pass for hi sister is realli hi wife. ” mrs. lyon had resum her seat . her hand were grasp the arm of her chair , and I saw that the pink nail had turn white with the pressur of her grip . “ hi wife ! ” she said again . “ hi wife ! He is not a marri man. ” sherlock holm shrug hi shoulder . “ prove it to me ! prove it to me ! and if you can do so -- ! ” the fierc flash of her eye said more than ani word . “ I have come prepar to do so , ” said holm , draw sever paper from hi pocket . “ here is a photograph of the coupl taken in york four year ago . It is indors ‘ Mr . and mrs. vandeleur , ’ but you will have no difficulti in recogn him , and her also , if you know her by sight . here are three written descript by trustworthi wit of mr. and mrs. vandeleur , who at that time kept st. oliv ’ s privat school . read them and see if you can doubt the ident of these people. ” she glanc at them , and then look up at us with the set , rigid face of a desper woman . “ Mr . holm , ” she said , “ thi man had offer me marriag on condit that I could get a divorc from my husband . He ha lie to me , the villain , in everi conceiv way . not one word of truth ha he ever told me . and whi -- whi ? I imagin that all wa for my own sake . but now I see that I wa never anyth but a tool in hi hand . whi should I preserv faith with him who never kept ani with me ? whi should I tri to shield him from the consequ of hi own wick act ? ask me what you like , and there is noth which I shall hold back . one thing I swear to you , and that is that when I wrote the letter I never dream of ani harm to the old gentleman , who had been my kindest friend. ” “ I entir believ you , madam , ” said sherlock holm . “ the recit of these event must be veri pain to you , and perhap it will make it easier if I tell you what occur , and you can check me if I make ani materi mistak . the send of thi letter wa suggest to you by stapleton ? ” “ He dictat it. ” “ I presum that the reason he gave wa that you would receiv help from sir charl for the legal expens connect with your divorc ? ” “ exactly. ” “ and then after you had sent the letter he dissuad you from keep the appoint ? ” “ He told me that it would hurt hi self-respect that ani other man should find the money for such an object , and that though he wa a poor man himself he would devot hi last penni to remov the obstacl which divid us. ” “ He appear to be a veri consist charact . and then you heard noth until you read the report of the death in the paper ? ” “ no. ” “ and he made you swear to say noth about your appoint with sir charl ? ” “ He did . He said that the death wa a veri mysteri one , and that I should certainli be suspect if the fact came out . He frighten me into remain silent. ” “ quit so . but you had your suspicion ? ” she hesit and look down . “ I knew him , ” she said . “ but if he had kept faith with me I should alway have done so with him. ” “ I think that on the whole you have had a fortun escap , ” said sherlock holm . “ you have had him in your power and he knew it , and yet you are aliv . you have been walk for some month veri near to the edg of a precipic . We must wish you good-morn now , mrs. lyon , and it is probabl that you will veri shortli hear from us again. ” “ our case becom round off , and difficulti after difficulti thin away in front of us , ” said holm as we stood wait for the arriv of the express from town . “ I shall soon be in the posit of be abl to put into a singl connect narr one of the most singular and sensat crime of modern time . student of criminolog will rememb the analog incid in godno , in littl russia , in the year ‘ 66 , and of cours there are the anderson murder in north carolina , but thi case possess some featur which are entir it own . even now we have no clear case against thi veri wili man . but I shall be veri much surpris if it is not clear enough befor we go to bed thi night. ” the london express came roar into the station , and a small , wiri bulldog of a man had sprung from a first-class carriag . We all three shook hand , and I saw at onc from the reverenti way in which lestrad gaze at my companion that he had learn a good deal sinc the day when they had first work togeth . I could well rememb the scorn which the theori of the reason use then to excit in the practic man . “ anyth good ? ” he ask . “ the biggest thing for year , ” said holm . “ We have two hour befor we need think of start . I think we might employ it in get some dinner and then , lestrad , we will take the london fog out of your throat by give you a breath of the pure night air of dartmoor . never been there ? Ah , well , I don ’ t suppos you will forget your first visit. ” chapter 14 . the hound of the baskervil one of sherlock holm ’ s defect -- if , inde , one may call it a defect -- wa that he wa exceedingli loath to commun hi full plan to ani other person until the instant of their fulfil . partli it came no doubt from hi own master natur , which love to domin and surpris those who were around him . partli also from hi profession caution , which urg him never to take ani chanc . the result , howev , wa veri tri for those who were act as hi agent and assist . I had often suffer under it , but never more so than dure that long drive in the dark . the great ordeal wa in front of us ; at last we were about to make our final effort , and yet holm had said noth , and I could onli surmis what hi cours of action would be . My nerv thrill with anticip when at last the cold wind upon our face and the dark , void space on either side of the narrow road told me that we were back upon the moor onc again . everi stride of the hors and everi turn of the wheel wa take us nearer to our suprem adventur . our convers wa hamper by the presenc of the driver of the hire wagonett , so that we were forc to talk of trivial matter when our nerv were tens with emot and anticip . It wa a relief to me , after that unnatur restraint , when we at last pass frankland ’ s hous and knew that we were draw near to the hall and to the scene of action . We did not drive up to the door but got down near the gate of the avenu . the wagonett wa paid off and order to return to coomb tracey forthwith , while we start to walk to merripit hous . “ are you arm , lestrad ? ” the littl detect smile . “ As long as I have my trouser I have a hip-pocket , and as long as I have my hip-pocket I have someth in it. ” “ good ! My friend and I are also readi for emergencies. ” “ you ’ re mighti close about thi affair , mr. holm . what ’ s the game now ? ” “ A wait game. ” “ My word , it doe not seem a veri cheer place , ” said the detect with a shiver , glanc round him at the gloomi slope of the hill and at the huge lake of fog which lay over the grimpen mire . “ I see the light of a hous ahead of us. ” “ that is merripit hous and the end of our journey . I must request you to walk on tipto and not to talk abov a whisper. ” We move cautious along the track as if we were bound for the hous , but holm halt us when we were about two hundr yard from it . “ thi will do , ” said he . “ these rock upon the right make an admir screen. ” “ We are to wait here ? ” “ ye , we shall make our littl ambush here . get into thi hollow , lestrad . you have been insid the hous , have you not , watson ? can you tell the posit of the room ? what are those lattic window at thi end ? ” “ I think they are the kitchen windows. ” “ and the one beyond , which shine so brightli ? ” “ that is certainli the dining-room. ” “ the blind are up . you know the lie of the land best . creep forward quietli and see what they are do -- but for heaven ’ s sake don ’ t let them know that they are watch ! ” I tipto down the path and stoop behind the low wall which surround the stunt orchard . creep in it shadow I reach a point whenc I could look straight through the uncurtain window . there were onli two men in the room , sir henri and stapleton . they sat with their profil toward me on either side of the round tabl . both of them were smoke cigar , and coffe and wine were in front of them . stapleton wa talk with anim , but the baronet look pale and distrait . perhap the thought of that lone walk across the ill-omen moor wa weigh heavili upon hi mind . As I watch them stapleton rose and left the room , while sir henri fill hi glass again and lean back in hi chair , puf at hi cigar . I heard the creak of a door and the crisp sound of boot upon gravel . the step pass along the path on the other side of the wall under which I crouch . look over , I saw the naturalist paus at the door of an out-hous in the corner of the orchard . A key turn in a lock , and as he pass in there wa a curiou scuffl nois from within . He wa onli a minut or so insid , and then I heard the key turn onc more and he pass me and reenter the hous . I saw him rejoin hi guest , and I crept quietli back to where my companion were wait to tell them what I had seen . “ you say , watson , that the ladi is not there ? ” holm ask when I had finish my report . “ no. ” “ where can she be , then , sinc there is no light in ani other room except the kitchen ? ” “ I can not think where she is. ” I have said that over the great grimpen mire there hung a dens , white fog . It wa drift slowli in our direct and bank itself up like a wall on that side of us , low but thick and well defin . the moon shone on it , and it look like a great shimmer ice-field , with the head of the distant tor as rock born upon it surfac . holm ’ s face wa turn toward it , and he mutter impati as he watch it sluggish drift . “ It ’ s move toward us , watson. ” “ Is that seriou ? ” “ veri seriou , inde -- the one thing upon earth which could have disarrang my plan . He can ’ t be veri long , now . It is alreadi ten o ’ clock . our success and even hi life may depend upon hi come out befor the fog is over the path. ” the night wa clear and fine abov us . the star shone cold and bright , while a half-moon bath the whole scene in a soft , uncertain light . befor us lay the dark bulk of the hous , it serrat roof and bristl chimney hard outlin against the silver-spangl sky . broad bar of golden light from the lower window stretch across the orchard and the moor . one of them wa suddenli shut off . the servant had left the kitchen . there onli remain the lamp in the dining-room where the two men , the murder host and the unconsci guest , still chat over their cigar . everi minut that white woolli plain which cover one-half of the moor wa drift closer and closer to the hous . alreadi the first thin wisp of it were curl across the golden squar of the light window . the farther wall of the orchard wa alreadi invis , and the tree were stand out of a swirl of white vapour . As we watch it the fog-wreath came crawl round both corner of the hous and roll slowli into one dens bank on which the upper floor and the roof float like a strang ship upon a shadowi sea . holm struck hi hand passion upon the rock in front of us and stamp hi feet in hi impati . “ If he isn ’ t out in a quarter of an hour the path will be cover . In half an hour we won ’ t be abl to see our hand in front of us. ” “ shall we move farther back upon higher ground ? ” “ ye , I think it would be as well. ” So as the fog-bank flow onward we fell back befor it until we were half a mile from the hous , and still that dens white sea , with the moon silver it upper edg , swept slowli and inexor on . “ We are go too far , ” said holm . “ We dare not take the chanc of hi be overtaken befor he can reach us . At all cost we must hold our ground where we are. ” He drop on hi knee and clap hi ear to the ground . “ thank god , I think that I hear him coming. ” A sound of quick step broke the silenc of the moor . crouch among the stone we stare intent at the silver-tip bank in front of us . the step grew louder , and through the fog , as through a curtain , there step the man whom we were await . He look round him in surpris as he emerg into the clear , starlit night . then he came swiftli along the path , pass close to where we lay , and went on up the long slope behind us . As he walk he glanc continu over either shoulder , like a man who is ill at eas . “ hist ! ” cri holm , and I heard the sharp click of a cock pistol . “ look out ! It ’ s come ! ” there wa a thin , crisp , continu patter from somewher in the heart of that crawl bank . the cloud wa within fifti yard of where we lay , and we glare at it , all three , uncertain what horror wa about to break from the heart of it . I wa at holm ’ s elbow , and I glanc for an instant at hi face . It wa pale and exult , hi eye shine brightli in the moonlight . but suddenli they start forward in a rigid , fix stare , and hi lip part in amaz . At the same instant lestrad gave a yell of terror and threw himself face downward upon the ground . I sprang to my feet , my inert hand grasp my pistol , my mind paralyz by the dread shape which had sprung out upon us from the shadow of the fog . A hound it wa , an enorm coal-black hound , but not such a hound as mortal eye have ever seen . fire burst from it open mouth , it eye glow with a smoulder glare , it muzzl and hackl and dewlap were outlin in flicker flame . never in the deliri dream of a disord brain could anyth more savag , more appal , more hellish be conceiv than that dark form and savag face which broke upon us out of the wall of fog . with long bound the huge black creatur wa leap down the track , follow hard upon the footstep of our friend . So paralyz were we by the apparit that we allow him to pass befor we had recov our nerv . then holm and I both fire togeth , and the creatur gave a hideou howl , which show that one at least had hit him . He did not paus , howev , but bound onward . far away on the path we saw sir henri look back , hi face white in the moonlight , hi hand rais in horror , glare helplessli at the fright thing which wa hunt him down . but that cri of pain from the hound had blown all our fear to the wind . If he wa vulner he wa mortal , and if we could wound him we could kill him . never have I seen a man run as holm ran that night . I am reckon fleet of foot , but he outpac me as much as I outpac the littl profession . In front of us as we flew up the track we heard scream after scream from sir henri and the deep roar of the hound . I wa in time to see the beast spring upon it victim , hurl him to the ground , and worri at hi throat . but the next instant holm had empti five barrel of hi revolv into the creatur ’ s flank . with a last howl of agoni and a viciou snap in the air , it roll upon it back , four feet paw furious , and then fell limp upon it side . I stoop , pant , and press my pistol to the dread , shimmer head , but it wa useless to press the trigger . the giant hound wa dead . sir henri lay insens where he had fallen . We tore away hi collar , and holm breath a prayer of gratitud when we saw that there wa no sign of a wound and that the rescu had been in time . alreadi our friend ’ s eyelid shiver and he made a feebl effort to move . lestrad thrust hi brandy-flask between the baronet ’ s teeth , and two frighten eye were look up at us . “ My god ! ” he whisper . “ what wa it ? what , in heaven ’ s name , wa it ? ” “ It ’ s dead , whatev it is , ” said holm . “ We ’ ve laid the famili ghost onc and forever. ” In mere size and strength it wa a terribl creatur which wa lie stretch befor us . It wa not a pure bloodhound and it wa not a pure mastiff ; but it appear to be a combin of the two -- gaunt , savag , and as larg as a small lioness . even now in the still of death , the huge jaw seem to be drip with a bluish flame and the small , deep-set , cruel eye were ring with fire . I place my hand upon the glow muzzl , and as I held them up my own finger smoulder and gleam in the dark . “ phosphoru , ” I said . “ A cun prepar of it , ” said holm , snif at the dead anim . “ there is no smell which might have interf with hi power of scent . We owe you a deep apolog , sir henri , for have expos you to thi fright . I wa prepar for a hound , but not for such a creatur as thi . and the fog gave us littl time to receiv him. ” “ you have save my life. ” “ have first endang it . are you strong enough to stand ? ” “ give me anoth mouth of that brandi and I shall be readi for anyth . So ! now , if you will help me up . what do you propos to do ? ” “ To leav you here . you are not fit for further adventur tonight . If you will wait , one or other of us will go back with you to the hall. ” He tri to stagger to hi feet ; but he wa still ghastli pale and trembl in everi limb . We help him to a rock , where he sat shiver with hi face buri in hi hand . “ We must leav you now , ” said holm . “ the rest of our work must be done , and everi moment is of import . We have our case , and now we onli want our man . “ It ’ s a thousand to one against our find him at the hous , ” he continu as we retrac our step swiftli down the path . “ those shot must have told him that the game wa up. ” “ We were some distanc off , and thi fog may have deaden them. ” “ He follow the hound to call him off -- of that you may be certain . No , no , he ’ s gone by thi time ! but we ’ ll search the hous and make sure. ” the front door wa open , so we rush in and hurri from room to room to the amaz of a dodder old manserv , who met us in the passag . there wa no light save in the dining-room , but holm caught up the lamp and left no corner of the hous unexplor . No sign could we see of the man whom we were chase . On the upper floor , howev , one of the bedroom door wa lock . “ there ’ s someon in here , ” cri lestrad . “ I can hear a movement . open thi door ! ” A faint moan and rustl came from within . holm struck the door just over the lock with the flat of hi foot and it flew open . pistol in hand , we all three rush into the room . but there wa no sign within it of that desper and defiant villain whom we expect to see . instead we were face by an object so strang and so unexpect that we stood for a moment stare at it in amaz . the room had been fashion into a small museum , and the wall were line by a number of glass-top case full of that collect of butterfli and moth the format of which had been the relax of thi complex and danger man . In the centr of thi room there wa an upright beam , which had been place at some period as a support for the old worm-eaten baulk of timber which span the roof . To thi post a figur wa tie , so swath and muffl in the sheet which had been use to secur it that one could not for the moment tell whether it wa that of a man or a woman . one towel pass round the throat and wa secur at the back of the pillar . anoth cover the lower part of the face , and over it two dark eye -- eye full of grief and shame and a dread question -- stare back at us . In a minut we had torn off the gag , unswath the bond , and mrs. stapleton sank upon the floor in front of us . As her beauti head fell upon her chest I saw the clear red weal of a whiplash across her neck . “ the brute ! ” cri holm . “ here , lestrad , your brandy-bottl ! put her in the chair ! she ha faint from ill-usag and exhaustion. ” she open her eye again . “ Is he safe ? ” she ask . “ ha he escap ? ” “ He can not escap us , madam. ” “ No , no , I did not mean my husband . sir henri ? Is he safe ? ” “ yes. ” “ and the hound ? ” “ It is dead. ” she gave a long sigh of satisfact . “ thank god ! thank god ! Oh , thi villain ! see how he ha treat me ! ” she shot her arm out from her sleev , and we saw with horror that they were all mottl with bruis . “ but thi is noth -- noth ! It is my mind and soul that he ha tortur and defil . I could endur it all , ill-usag , solitud , a life of decept , everyth , as long as I could still cling to the hope that I had hi love , but now I know that in thi also I have been hi dupe and hi tool. ” she broke into passion sob as she spoke . “ you bear him no good will , madam , ” said holm . “ tell us then where we shall find him . If you have ever aid him in evil , help us now and so atone. ” “ there is but one place where he can have fled , ” she answer . “ there is an old tin mine on an island in the heart of the mire . It wa there that he kept hi hound and there also he had made prepar so that he might have a refug . that is where he would fly. ” the fog-bank lay like white wool against the window . holm held the lamp toward it . “ see , ” said he . “ No one could find hi way into the grimpen mire tonight. ” she laugh and clap her hand . her eye and teeth gleam with fierc merriment . “ He may find hi way in , but never out , ” she cri . “ how can he see the guid wand tonight ? We plant them togeth , he and I , to mark the pathway through the mire . Oh , if I could onli have pluck them out today . then inde you would have had him at your merci ! ” It wa evid to us that all pursuit wa in vain until the fog had lift . meanwhil we left lestrad in possess of the hous while holm and I went back with the baronet to baskervil hall . the stori of the stapleton could no longer be withheld from him , but he took the blow brave when he learn the truth about the woman whom he had love . but the shock of the night ’ s adventur had shatter hi nerv , and befor morn he lay deliri in a high fever under the care of dr. mortim . the two of them were destin to travel togeth round the world befor sir henri had becom onc more the hale , hearti man that he had been befor he becam master of that ill-omen estat . and now I come rapidli to the conclus of thi singular narr , in which I have tri to make the reader share those dark fear and vagu surmis which cloud our live so long and end in so tragic a manner . On the morn after the death of the hound the fog had lift and we were guid by mrs. stapleton to the point where they had found a pathway through the bog . It help us to realiz the horror of thi woman ’ s life when we saw the eager and joy with which she laid us on her husband ’ s track . We left her stand upon the thin peninsula of firm , peati soil which taper out into the widespread bog . from the end of it a small wand plant here and there show where the path zigzag from tuft to tuft of rush among those green-scum pit and foul quagmir which bar the way to the stranger . rank reed and lush , slimi water-pl sent an odour of decay and a heavi miasmat vapour onto our face , while a fals step plung us more than onc thigh-deep into the dark , quiver mire , which shook for yard in soft undul around our feet . it tenaci grip pluck at our heel as we walk , and when we sank into it it wa as if some malign hand wa tug us down into those obscen depth , so grim and purpos wa the clutch in which it held us . onc onli we saw a trace that someon had pass that peril way befor us . from amid a tuft of cotton grass which bore it up out of the slime some dark thing wa project . holm sank to hi waist as he step from the path to seiz it , and had we not been there to drag him out he could never have set hi foot upon firm land again . He held an old black boot in the air . “ meyer , toronto , ” wa print on the leather insid . “ It is worth a mud bath , ” said he . “ It is our friend sir henri ’ s miss boot. ” “ thrown there by stapleton in hi flight. ” “ exactli . He retain it in hi hand after use it to set the hound upon the track . He fled when he knew the game wa up , still clutch it . and he hurl it away at thi point of hi flight . We know at least that he came so far in safety. ” but more than that we were never destin to know , though there wa much which we might surmis . there wa no chanc of find footstep in the mire , for the rise mud ooz swiftli in upon them , but as we at last reach firmer ground beyond the morass we all look eagerli for them . but no slightest sign of them ever met our eye . If the earth told a true stori , then stapleton never reach that island of refug toward which he struggl through the fog upon that last night . somewher in the heart of the great grimpen mire , down in the foul slime of the huge morass which had suck him in , thi cold and cruel-heart man is forev buri . mani trace we found of him in the bog-girt island where he had hid hi savag alli . A huge driving-wheel and a shaft half-fil with rubbish show the posit of an abandon mine . besid it were the crumbl remain of the cottag of the miner , driven away no doubt by the foul reek of the surround swamp . In one of these a stapl and chain with a quantiti of gnaw bone show where the anim had been confin . A skeleton with a tangl of brown hair adher to it lay among the debri . “ A dog ! ” said holm . “ By jove , a curly-hair spaniel . poor mortim will never see hi pet again . well , I do not know that thi place contain ani secret which we have not alreadi fathom . He could hide hi hound , but he could not hush it voic , and henc came those cri which even in daylight were not pleasant to hear . On an emerg he could keep the hound in the out-hous at merripit , but it wa alway a risk , and it wa onli on the suprem day , which he regard as the end of all hi effort , that he dare do it . thi past in the tin is no doubt the lumin mixtur with which the creatur wa daub . It wa suggest , of cours , by the stori of the famili hell-hound , and by the desir to frighten old sir charl to death . No wonder the poor devil of a convict ran and scream , even as our friend did , and as we ourselv might have done , when he saw such a creatur bound through the dark of the moor upon hi track . It wa a cun devic , for , apart from the chanc of drive your victim to hi death , what peasant would ventur to inquir too close into such a creatur should he get sight of it , as mani have done , upon the moor ? I said it in london , watson , and I say it again now , that never yet have we help to hunt down a more danger man than he who is lie yonder ” -- he swept hi long arm toward the huge mottl expans of green-splotch bog which stretch away until it merg into the russet slope of the moor . chapter 15 . A retrospect It wa the end of novemb , and holm and I sat , upon a raw and foggi night , on either side of a blaze fire in our sitting-room in baker street . sinc the tragic upshot of our visit to devonshir he had been engag in two affair of the utmost import , in the first of which he had expos the atroci conduct of colonel upwood in connect with the famou card scandal of the nonpareil club , while in the second he had defend the unfortun mme . montpensi from the charg of murder which hung over her in connect with the death of her step-daught , mlle . carer , the young ladi who , as it will be rememb , wa found six month later aliv and marri in new york . My friend wa in excel spirit over the success which had attend a success of difficult and import case , so that I wa abl to induc him to discuss the detail of the baskervil mysteri . I had wait patient for the opportun for I wa awar that he would never permit case to overlap , and that hi clear and logic mind would not be drawn from it present work to dwell upon memori of the past . sir henri and dr. mortim were , howev , in london , on their way to that long voyag which had been recommend for the restor of hi shatter nerv . they had call upon us that veri afternoon , so that it wa natur that the subject should come up for discuss . “ the whole cours of event , ” said holm , “ from the point of view of the man who call himself stapleton wa simpl and direct , although to us , who had no mean in the begin of know the motiv of hi action and could onli learn part of the fact , it all appear exceedingli complex . I have had the advantag of two convers with mrs. stapleton , and the case ha now been so entir clear up that I am not awar that there is anyth which ha remain a secret to us . you will find a few note upon the matter under the head B in my index list of cases. ” “ perhap you would kindli give me a sketch of the cours of event from memory. ” “ certainli , though I can not guarante that I carri all the fact in my mind . intens mental concentr ha a curiou way of blot out what ha pass . the barrist who ha hi case at hi finger ’ end and is abl to argu with an expert upon hi own subject find that a week or two of the court will drive it all out of hi head onc more . So each of my case displac the last , and mlle . carer ha blur my recollect of baskervil hall . tomorrow some other littl problem may be submit to my notic which will in turn dispossess the fair french ladi and the infam upwood . So far as the case of the hound goe , howev , I will give you the cours of event as nearli as I can , and you will suggest anyth which I may have forgotten . “ My inquiri show beyond all question that the famili portrait did not lie , and that thi fellow wa inde a baskervil . He wa a son of that rodger baskervil , the younger brother of sir charl , who fled with a sinist reput to south america , where he wa said to have die unmarri . He did , as a matter of fact , marri , and had one child , thi fellow , whose real name is the same as hi father ’ s . He marri beryl garcia , one of the beauti of costa rica , and , have purloin a consider sum of public money , he chang hi name to vandeleur and fled to england , where he establish a school in the east of yorkshir . hi reason for attempt thi special line of busi wa that he had struck up an acquaint with a consumpt tutor upon the voyag home , and that he had use thi man ’ s abil to make the undertak a success . fraser , the tutor , die howev , and the school which had begun well sank from disreput into infami . the vandeleur found it conveni to chang their name to stapleton , and he brought the remain of hi fortun , hi scheme for the futur , and hi tast for entomolog to the south of england . I learn at the british museum that he wa a recogn author upon the subject , and that the name of vandeleur ha been perman attach to a certain moth which he had , in hi yorkshir day , been the first to describ . “ We now come to that portion of hi life which ha prove to be of such intens interest to us . the fellow had evid made inquiri and found that onli two live interven between him and a valuabl estat . when he went to devonshir hi plan were , I believ , exceedingli hazi , but that he meant mischief from the first is evid from the way in which he took hi wife with him in the charact of hi sister . the idea of use her as a decoy wa clearli alreadi in hi mind , though he may not have been certain how the detail of hi plot were to be arrang . He meant in the end to have the estat , and he wa readi to use ani tool or run ani risk for that end . hi first act wa to establish himself as near to hi ancestr home as he could , and hi second wa to cultiv a friendship with sir charl baskervil and with the neighbour . “ the baronet himself told him about the famili hound , and so prepar the way for hi own death . stapleton , as I will continu to call him , knew that the old man ’ s heart wa weak and that a shock would kill him . So much he had learn from dr. mortim . He had heard also that sir charl wa superstiti and had taken thi grim legend veri serious . hi ingeni mind instantli suggest a way by which the baronet could be done to death , and yet it would be hardli possibl to bring home the guilt to the real murder . “ have conceiv the idea he proceed to carri it out with consider finess . An ordinari schemer would have been content to work with a savag hound . the use of artifici mean to make the creatur diabol wa a flash of geniu upon hi part . the dog he bought in london from ross and mangl , the dealer in fulham road . It wa the strongest and most savag in their possess . He brought it down by the north devon line and walk a great distanc over the moor so as to get it home without excit ani remark . He had alreadi on hi insect hunt learn to penetr the grimpen mire , and so had found a safe hiding-plac for the creatur . here he kennel it and wait hi chanc . “ but it wa some time come . the old gentleman could not be decoy outsid of hi ground at night . sever time stapleton lurk about with hi hound , but without avail . It wa dure these fruitless quest that he , or rather hi alli , wa seen by peasant , and that the legend of the demon dog receiv a new confirm . He had hope that hi wife might lure sir charl to hi ruin , but here she prove unexpectedli independ . she would not endeavour to entangl the old gentleman in a sentiment attach which might deliv him over to hi enemi . threat and even , I am sorri to say , blow refus to move her . she would have noth to do with it , and for a time stapleton wa at a deadlock . “ He found a way out of hi difficulti through the chanc that sir charl , who had conceiv a friendship for him , made him the minist of hi chariti in the case of thi unfortun woman , mrs. laura lyon . By repres himself as a singl man he acquir complet influenc over her , and he gave her to understand that in the event of her obtain a divorc from her husband he would marri her . hi plan were suddenli brought to a head by hi knowledg that sir charl wa about to leav the hall on the advic of dr. mortim , with whose opinion he himself pretend to coincid . He must act at onc , or hi victim might get beyond hi power . He therefor put pressur upon mrs. lyon to write thi letter , implor the old man to give her an interview on the even befor hi departur for london . He then , by a speciou argument , prevent her from go , and so had the chanc for which he had wait . “ drive back in the even from coomb tracey he wa in time to get hi hound , to treat it with hi infern paint , and to bring the beast round to the gate at which he had reason to expect that he would find the old gentleman wait . the dog , incit by it master , sprang over the wicket-g and pursu the unfortun baronet , who fled scream down the yew alley . In that gloomi tunnel it must inde have been a dread sight to see that huge black creatur , with it flame jaw and blaze eye , bound after it victim . He fell dead at the end of the alley from heart diseas and terror . the hound had kept upon the grassi border while the baronet had run down the path , so that no track but the man ’ s wa visibl . On see him lie still the creatur had probabl approach to sniff at him , but find him dead had turn away again . It wa then that it left the print which wa actual observ by dr. mortim . the hound wa call off and hurri away to it lair in the grimpen mire , and a mysteri wa left which puzzl the author , alarm the countrysid , and final brought the case within the scope of our observ . “ So much for the death of sir charl baskervil . you perceiv the devilish cun of it , for realli it would be almost imposs to make a case against the real murder . hi onli accomplic wa one who could never give him away , and the grotesqu , inconceiv natur of the devic onli serv to make it more effect . both of the women concern in the case , mrs. stapleton and mrs. laura lyon , were left with a strong suspicion against stapleton . mrs. stapleton knew that he had design upon the old man , and also of the exist of the hound . mrs. lyon knew neither of these thing , but had been impress by the death occur at the time of an uncancel appoint which wa onli known to him . howev , both of them were under hi influenc , and he had noth to fear from them . the first half of hi task wa success accomplish but the more difficult still remain . “ It is possibl that stapleton did not know of the exist of an heir in canada . In ani case he would veri soon learn it from hi friend dr. mortim , and he wa told by the latter all detail about the arriv of henri baskervil . stapleton ’ s first idea wa that thi young stranger from canada might possibl be done to death in london without come down to devonshir at all . He distrust hi wife ever sinc she had refus to help him in lay a trap for the old man , and he dare not leav her long out of hi sight for fear he should lose hi influenc over her . It wa for thi reason that he took her to london with him . they lodg , I find , at the mexborough privat hotel , in craven street , which wa actual one of those call upon by my agent in search of evid . here he kept hi wife imprison in her room while he , disguis in a beard , follow dr. mortim to baker street and afterward to the station and to the northumberland hotel . hi wife had some inkl of hi plan ; but she had such a fear of her husband -- a fear found upon brutal ill-treat -- that she dare not write to warn the man whom she knew to be in danger . If the letter should fall into stapleton ’ s hand her own life would not be safe . eventu , as we know , she adopt the expedi of cut out the word which would form the messag , and address the letter in a disguis hand . It reach the baronet , and gave him the first warn of hi danger . “ It wa veri essenti for stapleton to get some articl of sir henri ’ s attir so that , in case he wa driven to use the dog , he might alway have the mean of set him upon hi track . with characterist prompt and audac he set about thi at onc , and we can not doubt that the boot or chamber-maid of the hotel wa well bribe to help him in hi design . By chanc , howev , the first boot which wa procur for him wa a new one and , therefor , useless for hi purpos . He then had it return and obtain anoth -- a most instruct incid , sinc it prove conclus to my mind that we were deal with a real hound , as no other supposit could explain thi anxieti to obtain an old boot and thi indiffer to a new one . the more outr and grotesqu an incid is the more care it deserv to be examin , and the veri point which appear to complic a case is , when duli consid and scientif handl , the one which is most like to elucid it . “ then we had the visit from our friend next morn , shadow alway by stapleton in the cab . from hi knowledg of our room and of my appear , as well as from hi gener conduct , I am inclin to think that stapleton ’ s career of crime ha been by no mean limit to thi singl baskervil affair . It is suggest that dure the last three year there have been four consider burglari in the west countri , for none of which wa ani crimin ever arrest . the last of these , at folkeston court , in may , wa remark for the cold-blood pistol of the page , who surpris the mask and solitari burglar . I can not doubt that stapleton recruit hi wane resourc in thi fashion , and that for year he ha been a desper and danger man . “ We had an exampl of hi readi of resourc that morn when he got away from us so success , and also of hi audac in send back my own name to me through the cabman . from that moment he understood that I had taken over the case in london , and that therefor there wa no chanc for him there . He return to dartmoor and await the arriv of the baronet. ” “ one moment ! ” said I . “ you have , no doubt , describ the sequenc of event correctli , but there is one point which you have left unexplain . what becam of the hound when it master wa in london ? ” “ I have given some attent to thi matter and it is undoubtedli of import . there can be no question that stapleton had a confid , though it is unlik that he ever place himself in hi power by share all hi plan with him . there wa an old manserv at merripit hous , whose name wa anthoni . hi connect with the stapleton can be trace for sever year , as far back as the school-mast day , so that he must have been awar that hi master and mistress were realli husband and wife . thi man ha disappear and ha escap from the countri . It is suggest that anthoni is not a common name in england , while antonio is so in all spanish or spanish-american countri . the man , like mrs. stapleton herself , spoke good english , but with a curiou lisp accent . I have myself seen thi old man cross the grimpen mire by the path which stapleton had mark out . It is veri probabl , therefor , that in the absenc of hi master it wa he who care for the hound , though he may never have known the purpos for which the beast wa use . “ the stapleton then went down to devonshir , whither they were soon follow by sir henri and you . one word now as to how I stood myself at that time . It may possibl recur to your memori that when I examin the paper upon which the print word were fasten I made a close inspect for the water-mark . In do so I held it within a few inch of my eye , and wa consciou of a faint smell of the scent known as white jessamin . there are seventy-f perfum , which it is veri necessari that a crimin expert should be abl to distinguish from each other , and case have more than onc within my own experi depend upon their prompt recognit . the scent suggest the presenc of a ladi , and alreadi my thought began to turn toward the stapleton . thu I had made certain of the hound , and had guess at the crimin befor ever we went to the west countri . “ It wa my game to watch stapleton . It wa evid , howev , that I could not do thi if I were with you , sinc he would be keenli on hi guard . I deceiv everybodi , therefor , yourself includ , and I came down secretli when I wa suppos to be in london . My hardship were not so great as you imagin , though such trifl detail must never interfer with the investig of a case . I stay for the most part at coomb tracey , and onli use the hut upon the moor when it wa necessari to be near the scene of action . cartwright had come down with me , and in hi disguis as a countri boy he wa of great assist to me . I wa depend upon him for food and clean linen . when I wa watch stapleton , cartwright wa frequent watch you , so that I wa abl to keep my hand upon all the string . “ I have alreadi told you that your report reach me rapidli , be forward instantli from baker street to coomb tracey . they were of great servic to me , and especi that one incident truth piec of biographi of stapleton ’ s . I wa abl to establish the ident of the man and the woman and knew at last exactli how I stood . the case had been consider complic through the incid of the escap convict and the relat between him and the barrymor . thi also you clear up in a veri effect way , though I had alreadi come to the same conclus from my own observ . “ By the time that you discov me upon the moor I had a complet knowledg of the whole busi , but I had not a case which could go to a juri . even stapleton ’ s attempt upon sir henri that night which end in the death of the unfortun convict did not help us much in prove murder against our man . there seem to be no altern but to catch him red-hand , and to do so we had to use sir henri , alon and appar unprotect , as a bait . We did so , and at the cost of a sever shock to our client we succeed in complet our case and drive stapleton to hi destruct . that sir henri should have been expos to thi is , I must confess , a reproach to my manag of the case , but we had no mean of forese the terribl and paralyz spectacl which the beast present , nor could we predict the fog which enabl him to burst upon us at such short notic . We succeed in our object at a cost which both the specialist and dr. mortim assur me will be a temporari one . A long journey may enabl our friend to recov not onli from hi shatter nerv but also from hi wound feel . hi love for the ladi wa deep and sincer , and to him the saddest part of all thi black busi wa that he should have been deceiv by her . “ It onli remain to indic the part which she had play throughout . there can be no doubt that stapleton exercis an influenc over her which may have been love or may have been fear , or veri possibl both , sinc they are by no mean incompat emot . It wa , at least , absolut effect . At hi command she consent to pass as hi sister , though he found the limit of hi power over her when he endeavour to make her the direct accessori to murder . she wa readi to warn sir henri so far as she could without implic her husband , and again and again she tri to do so . stapleton himself seem to have been capabl of jealousi , and when he saw the baronet pay court to the ladi , even though it wa part of hi own plan , still he could not help interrupt with a passion outburst which reveal the fieri soul which hi self-contain manner so cleverli conceal . By encourag the intimaci he made it certain that sir henri would frequent come to merripit hous and that he would sooner or later get the opportun which he desir . On the day of the crisi , howev , hi wife turn suddenli against him . she had learn someth of the death of the convict , and she knew that the hound wa be kept in the outhous on the even that sir henri wa come to dinner . she tax her husband with hi intend crime , and a furiou scene follow in which he show her for the first time that she had a rival in hi love . her fidel turn in an instant to bitter hatr , and he saw that she would betray him . He tie her up , therefor , that she might have no chanc of warn sir henri , and he hope , no doubt , that when the whole countrysid put down the baronet ’ s death to the curs of hi famili , as they certainli would do , he could win hi wife back to accept an accomplish fact and to keep silent upon what she knew . In thi I fanci that in ani case he made a miscalcul , and that , if we had not been there , hi doom would none the less have been seal . A woman of spanish blood doe not condon such an injuri so lightli . and now , my dear watson , without refer to my note , I can not give you a more detail account of thi curiou case . I do not know that anyth essenti ha been left unexplained. ” “ He could not hope to frighten sir henri to death as he had done the old uncl with hi bogi hound. ” “ the beast wa savag and half-starv . If it appear did not frighten it victim to death , at least it would paralyz the resist which might be offered. ” “ No doubt . there onli remain one difficulti . If stapleton came into the success , how could he explain the fact that he , the heir , had been live unannounc under anoth name so close to the properti ? how could he claim it without caus suspicion and inquiri ? ” “ It is a formid difficulti , and I fear that you ask too much when you expect me to solv it . the past and the present are within the field of my inquiri , but what a man may do in the futur is a hard question to answer . mrs. stapleton ha heard her husband discuss the problem on sever occas . there were three possibl cours . He might claim the properti from south america , establish hi ident befor the british author there and so obtain the fortun without ever come to england at all , or he might adopt an elabor disguis dure the short time that he need be in london ; or , again , he might furnish an accomplic with the proof and paper , put him in as heir , and retain a claim upon some proport of hi incom . We can not doubt from what we know of him that he would have found some way out of the difficulti . and now , my dear watson , we have had some week of sever work , and for one even , I think , we may turn our thought into more pleasant channel . I have a box for ‘ le huguenots. ’ have you heard the De reszk ? might I troubl you then to be readi in half an hour , and we can stop at marcini ’ s for a littl dinner on the way ? ”
