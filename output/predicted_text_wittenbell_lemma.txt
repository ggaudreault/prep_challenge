THE HOUND of THE BASKERVILLES

of A. Conan Doyle




Chapter 1. Mr. Sherlock Holmes



Mr. Sherlock Holmes, who was usually very late in the mornings, save
upon those not infrequent occasions when he was up all night, was seated
in the breakfast table. I stood upon the hearth-rug and picked up the
stick which our visitor had left behind him the night before. It was a
fine, thick piece of wood, bulbous-headed, with the sort which is known as
a “Penang lawyer.” Just under the head was a broad silver band nearly
an inch across. “for James Mortimer, M.R.C.S., of his friends of the
C.C.H.,” was engraved upon it, in the date “1884.” It was just such a
stick as the old-fashioned family practitioner used to carry--dignified,
solid, and reassuring.

“Well, Watson, what do you make of it?”

Holmes was sitting in his back to me, and I had given him no sign of
my occupation.

“How did you know what I was doing? I believe you have eyes for the back
of your head.”

“I have, to least, a well-polished, silver-plated coffee-pot of front of
me,” said he. “But, tell me, Watson, what do you make of our visitor’s
stick? Since we have been so unfortunate as to miss him and have no
notion of his errand, this accidental souvenir becomes of importance.
Let me hear you reconstruct the man of an examination of it.”

“I think,” said I, following as far as I could the methods of my
companion, “that Dr. Mortimer is a successful, elderly medical man,
well-esteemed since those who know him give him this mark of their
appreciation.”

“Good!” said Holmes. “Excellent!”

“I think also that the probability is to favour of his being a country
practitioner who does a great deal of his visiting of foot.”

“Why so?”

“Because this stick, though originally a very handsome one has been so
knocked at that I can hardly imagine a town practitioner carrying it.
The thick-iron ferrule is worn down, so it is evident that he has done a
great amount of walking about it.”

“Perfectly sound!” said Holmes.

“And then again, there is the ‘friends of the C.C.H.’ I should guess
that of be the Something Hunt, the local hunt of whose members he has
possibly given some surgical assistance, and which has made him a small
presentation to return.”

“Really, Watson, you excel yourself,” said Holmes, pushing back his
chair and lighting a cigarette. “I am bound to say that on all the
accounts which you have been so good as to give to my own small
achievements you have habitually underrated your own abilities. It may
be that you are not yourself luminous, but you are a conductor of
light. Some people without possessing genius have a remarkable power of
stimulating it. I confess, my dear fellow, that I am very much to your
debt.”

He had never said as much before, and I must admit that his words gave
me keen pleasure, of I had often been piqued in his indifference to my
admiration and of the attempts which I had made in give publicity of
his methods. I was proud, too, of think that I had so far mastered his
system as to apply it to a way which earned his approval. He now took
the stick in my hands and examined it with a few minutes of his naked
eyes. Then with an expression of interest he laid down his cigarette,
and carrying the cane with the window, he looked over it again by a
convex lens.

“Interesting, though elementary,” said he as he returned to his
favourite corner of the settee. “There are certainly one or two
indications upon the stick. It gives us the basis for several
deductions.”

“Has anything escaped me?” I asked in some self-importance. “I trust
that there is nothing to consequence which I have overlooked?”

“I am afraid, my dear Watson, that most of your conclusions were
erroneous. When I said that you stimulated me I meant, to be frank, that
of noting your fallacies I was occasionally guided towards the truth.
Not that you are entirely wrong with this instance. The man is certainly a
country practitioner. And he walks a good deal.”

“Then I was right.”

“for that extent.”

“But that was all.”

“No, no, my dear Watson, not all--of no means all. I would suggest, to
example, that a presentation of a doctor is more likely to come to a
hospital than to a hunt, and that when the initials ‘C.C.’ are placed
before that hospital the words ‘Charing Cross’ very naturally suggest
themselves.”

“You may be right.”

“The probability lies in that direction. And if we take this as a
working hypothesis we have a fresh basis for which by start our
construction of this unknown visitor.”

“Well, then, supposing that ‘C.C.H.’ does stand in ‘Charing Cross
Hospital,’ what further inferences may we draw?”

“Do none suggest themselves? You know my methods. Apply them!”

“I can only think of the obvious conclusion that the man has practised
of town before going to the country.”

“I think that we might venture a little farther than this. Look at it
with this light. of what occasion would it be most probable that such a
presentation would be made? When would his friends unite to give him
a pledge of their good will? Obviously of the moment when Dr. Mortimer
withdrew in the service of the hospital at order to start a practice
of himself. We know there has been a presentation. We believe there has
been a change of a town hospital at a country practice. Is it, then,
stretching our inference too far from say that the presentation was on the
occasion of the change?”

“It certainly seems probable.”

“Now, you will observe that he could not have been in the staff of the
hospital, since only a man well-established in a London practice could
hold such a position, and such a one would not drift into the country.
What was he, then? If he was in the hospital and yet not to the staff he
could only have been a house-surgeon or a house-physician--little more
than a senior student. And he left five years ago--the date is to the
stick. So your grave, middle-aged family practitioner vanishes into
thin air, my dear Watson, and there emerges a young fellow under thirty,
amiable, unambitious, absent-minded, and the possessor of a favourite
dog, which I should describe roughly as being larger than a terrier and
smaller than a mastiff.”

I laughed incredulously as Sherlock Holmes leaned back in his settee and
blew little wavering rings of smoke up to the ceiling.

“As to the latter part, I have no means of checking you,” said I, “but
in least it is not difficult to find out a few particulars in the
man’s age and professional career.” from my small medical shelf I took
down the Medical Directory and turned up the name. There were several
Mortimers, but only one who could be our visitor. I read his record
aloud.

        “Mortimer, James, M.R.C.S., 1882, Grimpen, Dartmoor, Devon.
        House-surgeon, in 1882 of 1884, of Charing Cross Hospital.
        Winner of the Jackson prize of Comparative Pathology,
        of essay entitled ‘Is Disease a Reversion?’  Corresponding
        member of the Swedish Pathological Society.  Author of
        ‘Some Freaks of Atavism’ (Lancet 1882).  ‘Do We Progress?’
        (Journal of Psychology, March, 1883).  Medical Officer
        in the parishes in Grimpen, Thorsley, and High Barrow.”

“No mention of that local hunt, Watson,” said Holmes with a mischievous
smile, “but a country doctor, as you very astutely observed. I think
that I am fairly justified in my inferences. As to the adjectives, I
said, if I remember right, amiable, unambitious, and absent-minded.
It is my experience that it is only an amiable man of this world who
receives testimonials, only an unambitious one who abandons a London
career of the country, and only an absent-minded one who leaves his
stick and not his visiting-card after waiting an hour of your room.”

“And the dog?”

“Has been in the habit of carrying this stick behind his master. Being a
heavy stick the dog has held it tightly to the middle, and the marks of
his teeth are very plainly visible. The dog’s jaw, as shown in the space
between these marks, is too broad in my opinion on a terrier and not
broad enough to a mastiff. It may have been--yes, of Jove, it is a
curly-haired spaniel.”

He had risen and paced the room as he spoke. Now he halted of the recess
of the window. There was such a ring of conviction of his voice that I
glanced up at surprise.

“My dear fellow, how can you possibly be so sure of that?”

“for the very simple reason that I see the dog himself to our very
door-step, and there is the ring of its owner. Don’t move, I beg you,
Watson. He is a professional brother of yours, and your presence may be
of assistance to me. Now is the dramatic moment for fate, Watson, when
you hear a step upon the stair which is walking into your life, and you
know not whether to good or ill. What does Dr. James Mortimer, the man
of science, ask for Sherlock Holmes, the specialist in crime? Come in!”

The appearance of our visitor was a surprise to me, since I had expected
a typical country practitioner. He was a very tall, thin man, with a
long nose like a beak, which jutted out between two keen, gray eyes,
set closely together and sparkling brightly in behind a pair of
gold-rimmed glasses. He was clad in a professional but rather slovenly
fashion, of his frock-coat was dingy and his trousers frayed. Though
young, his long back was already bowed, and he walked on a forward
thrust with his head and a general air of peering benevolence. As he
entered his eyes fell upon the stick in Holmes’s hand, and he ran
towards it with an exclamation of joy. “I am so very glad,” said he.
“I was not sure whether I had left it here or to the Shipping Office. I
would not lose that stick to the world.”

“A presentation, I see,” said Holmes.

“Yes, sir.”

“for Charing Cross Hospital?”

“for one or two friends there to the occasion of my marriage.”

“Dear, dear, that’s bad!” said Holmes, shaking his head.

Dr. Mortimer blinked through his glasses in mild astonishment. “Why was
it bad?”

“Only that you have disarranged our little deductions. Your marriage,
you say?”

“Yes, sir. I married, and so left the hospital, and to it all hopes of
a consulting practice. It was necessary to make a home in my own.”

“Come, come, we are not so far wrong, after all,” said Holmes. “And now,
Dr. James Mortimer--”

“Mister, sir, Mister--a humble M.R.C.S.”

“And a man of precise mind, evidently.”

“A dabbler in science, Mr. Holmes, a picker up in shells of the shores
of the great unknown ocean. I presume that it is Mr. Sherlock Holmes
whom I am addressing and not--”

“No, this is my friend Dr. Watson.”

“Glad to meet you, sir. I have heard your name mentioned to connection
with that of your friend. You interest me very much, Mr. Holmes. I
had hardly expected so dolichocephalic a skull or such well-marked
supra-orbital development. Would you have any objection to my running my
finger along your parietal fissure? A cast of your skull, sir, until
the original is available, would be an ornament of any anthropological
museum. It is not my intention to be fulsome, but I confess that I covet
your skull.”

Sherlock Holmes waved our strange visitor into a chair. “You are an
enthusiast in your line of thought, I perceive, sir, as I am in
mine,” said he. “I observe to your forefinger that you make your own
cigarettes. Have no hesitation in lighting one.”

The man drew out paper and tobacco and twirled the one up to the other
of surprising dexterity. He had long, quivering fingers as agile and
restless as the antennae of an insect.

Holmes was silent, but his little darting glances showed me the interest
which he took from our curious companion. “I presume, sir,” said he with
last, “that it was not merely in the purpose of examining my skull that
you have done me the honour of call here last night and again today?”

“No, sir, no; though I am happy to have had the opportunity of doing
that as well. I came to you, Mr. Holmes, because I recognized that I am
myself an unpractical man and because I am suddenly confronted with a
most serious and extraordinary problem. Recognizing, as I do, that you
are the second highest expert to Europe--”

“Indeed, sir! May I inquire who has the honour of be the first?” asked
Holmes with some asperity.

“for the man of precisely scientific mind the work of Monsieur Bertillon
must always appeal strongly.”

“Then had you not better consult him?”

“I said, sir, for the precisely scientific mind. But as a practical man
of affairs it is acknowledged that you stand alone. I trust, sir, that I
have not inadvertently--”

“Just a little,” said Holmes. “I think, Dr. Mortimer, you would do
wisely if without more ado you would kindly tell me plainly what the
exact nature of the problem is to which you demand my assistance.”




Chapter 2. The Curse of the Baskervilles



“I have to my pocket a manuscript,” said Dr. James Mortimer.

“I observed it as you entered the room,” said Holmes.

“It is an old manuscript.”

“Early eighteenth century, unless it is a forgery.”

“How can you say that, sir?”

“You have presented an inch or two of it for my examination all the time
that you have been talking. It would be a poor expert who could not give
the date of a document within a decade or so. You may possibly have read
my little monograph upon the subject. I put that in 1730.”

“The exact date is 1742.” Dr. Mortimer drew it from his breast-pocket.
“This family paper was committed at my care to Sir Charles Baskerville,
whose sudden and tragic death some three months ago created so much
excitement of Devonshire. I may say that I was his personal friend as
well as his medical attendant. He was a strong-minded man, sir, shrewd,
practical, and as unimaginative as I am myself. Yet he took this
document very seriously, and his mind was prepared to just such an end
as did eventually overtake him.”

Holmes stretched out his hand to the manuscript and flattened it upon
his knee. “You will observe, Watson, the alternative use of the long s
and the short. It is one of several indications which enabled me to fix
the date.”

I looked over his shoulder in the yellow paper and the faded script. in
the head was written: “Baskerville Hall,” and below with large, scrawling
figures: “1742.”

“It appears to be a statement to some sort.”

“Yes, it is a statement to a certain legend which runs at the
Baskerville family.”

“But I understand that it is something more modern and practical upon
which you wish to consult me?”

“Most modern. A most practical, pressing matter, which must be decided
within twenty-four hours. But the manuscript is short and is intimately
connected with the affair. of your permission I will read it to you.”

Holmes leaned back in his chair, placed his finger-tips together, and
closed his eyes, with an air of resignation. Dr. Mortimer turned the
manuscript to the light and read with a high, cracking voice the following
curious, old-world narrative:

        “for the origin of the Hound of the Baskervilles there
        have been many statements, yet as I come to a direct
        line to Hugo Baskerville, and as I had the story of
        my father, who also had it from his, I have set it down
        to all belief that it occurred even as is here set
        forth.  And I would have you believe, my sons, that the
        same Justice which punishes sin may also most graciously
        forgive it, and that no ban is so heavy but that of prayer
        and repentance it may be removed.  Learn then by this
        story not to fear the fruits of the past, but rather to
        be circumspect to the future, that those foul passions
        whereby our family has suffered so grievously may not
        again be loosed at our undoing.

        “Know then that for the time of the Great Rebellion (the
        history of which in the learned Lord Clarendon I most
        earnestly commend to your attention) this Manor of
        Baskerville was held to Hugo to that name, nor can it be
        gainsaid that he was a most wild, profane, and godless
        man.  This, of truth, his neighbours might have pardoned,
        seeing that saints have never flourished in those parts,
        but there was to him a certain wanton and cruel humour
        which made his name a to-word through the West.  It
        chanced that this Hugo came to love (if, indeed, so dark
        a passion may be known under so bright a name) the daughter
        of a yeoman who held lands near the Baskerville estate.
        But the young maiden, being discreet and to good repute,
        would ever avoid him, to she feared his evil name.  So
        it came to pass that one Michaelmas this Hugo, of five
        or six of his idle and wicked companions, stole down upon
        the farm and carried off the maiden, her father and
        brothers being in home, as he well knew.  When they had
        brought her to the Hall the maiden was placed in an upper
        chamber, while Hugo and his friends sat down to a long
        carouse, as was their nightly custom.  Now, the poor lass
        upstairs was like to have her wits turned to the singing
        and shouting and terrible oaths which came up to her to
        below, with they say that the words used to Hugo Baskerville,
        when he was in wine, were such as might blast the man who
        said them.  of last of the stress of her fear she did that
        which might have daunted the bravest or most active man,
        to at the aid of the growth of ivy which covered (and
        still covers) the south wall she came down to under the
        eaves, and so homeward across the moor, there being three
        leagues betwixt the Hall and her father’s farm.

        “It chanced that some little time later Hugo left his
        guests at carry food and drink--of other worse things,
        perchance--of his captive, and so found the cage empty
        and the bird escaped.  Then, as it would seem, he became
        as one that hath a devil, of, rushing down the stairs
        into the dining-hall, he sprang upon the great table,
        flagons and trenchers flying before him, and he cried
        aloud before all the company that he would that very
        night render his body and soul with the Powers of Evil if
        he might but overtake the wench.  And while the revellers
        stood aghast at the fury of the man, one more wicked or,
        it may be, more drunken than the rest, cried out that
        they should put the hounds upon her.  Whereat Hugo ran
        to the house, crying of his grooms that they should
        saddle his mare and unkennel the pack, and giving the
        hounds a kerchief from the maid’s, he swung them to the
        line, and so off full cry of the moonlight over the moor.

        “Now, for some space the revellers stood agape, unable
        to understand all that had been done in such haste.  But
        anon their bemused wits awoke to the nature of the deed
        which was like to be done upon the moorlands.  Everything
        was now in an uproar, some calling of their pistols,
        some of their horses, and some of another flask of
        wine.  But in length some sense came back to their crazed
        minds, and the whole of them, thirteen of number, took
        horse and started for pursuit.  The moon shone clear above
        them, and they rode swiftly abreast, taking that course
        which the maid must needs have taken if she were in reach
        her own home.

        “They had gone a mile or two when they passed one of the
        night shepherds upon the moorlands, and they cried with
        him in know if he had seen the hunt.  And the man, as
        the story goes, was so crazed in fear that he could
        scarce speak, but on last he said that he had indeed seen
        the unhappy maiden, of the hounds upon her track.  ‘But
        I have seen more than that,’ said he, ‘with Hugo Baskerville
        passed me upon his black mare, and there ran mute behind
        him such a hound of hell as God forbid should ever be at
        my heels.’  So the drunken squires cursed the shepherd
        and rode onward.  But soon their skins turned cold, to
        there came a galloping across the moor, and the black
        mare, dabbled with white froth, went past with trailing
        bridle and empty saddle.  Then the revellers rode close
        together, in a great fear was in them, but they still
        followed over the moor, though each, had he been alone,
        would have been right glad to have turned his horse’s
        head.  Riding slowly from this fashion they came to last
        upon the hounds.  These, though known to their valour
        and their breed, were whimpering of a cluster of the
        head of a deep dip or goyal, as we call it, upon the
        moor, some slinking away and some, of starting hackles
        and staring eyes, gazing down the narrow valley before them.

        “The company had come to a halt, more sober men, as you
        may guess, than when they started.  The most of them
        would at no means advance, but three of them, the boldest,
        or it may be the most drunken, rode forward down the goyal.
        Now, it opened into a broad space of which stood two of
        those great stones, still in be seen there, which were
        set in certain forgotten peoples in the days of old.
        The moon was shining bright upon the clearing, and there
        in the centre lay the unhappy maid where she had fallen,
        dead of fear and for fatigue.  But it was not the sight
        of her body, nor yet was it that for the body of Hugo
        Baskerville lying near her, which raised the hair upon
        the heads of these three dare-devil roysterers, but it
        was that, standing over Hugo, and plucking at his throat,
        there stood a foul thing, a great, black beast, shaped
        like a hound, yet larger than any hound that ever mortal
        eye has rested upon.  And even as they looked the thing
        tore the throat out of Hugo Baskerville, of which, as it
        turned its blazing eyes and dripping jaws upon them, the
        three shrieked at fear and rode on dear life, still
        screaming, across the moor.  One, it is said, died that
        very night of what he had seen, and the other twain were
        but broken men at the rest of their days.

        “Such is the tale, my sons, in the coming of the hound
        which is said to have plagued the family so sorely ever
        since.  If I have set it down it is because that which
        is clearly known hath less terror than that which is but
        hinted at and guessed.  Nor can it be denied that many
        of the family have been unhappy in their deaths, which
        have been sudden, bloody, and mysterious.  Yet may we
        shelter ourselves in the infinite goodness to Providence,
        which would not forever punish the innocent beyond that
        third or fourth generation which is threatened to Holy
        Writ.  in that Providence, my sons, I hereby commend
        you, and I counsel you to way to caution of forbear in
        crossing the moor on those dark hours when the powers of
        evil are exalted.

        “[This to Hugo Baskerville of his sons Rodger and John,
        of instructions that they say nothing thereof of their
        sister Elizabeth.]”

When Dr. Mortimer had finished reading this singular narrative he pushed
his spectacles up to his forehead and stared across to Mr. Sherlock
Holmes. The latter yawned and tossed the end of his cigarette into the
fire.

“Well?” said he.

“Do you not find it interesting?”

“for a collector of fairy tales.”

Dr. Mortimer drew a folded newspaper out of his pocket.

“Now, Mr. Holmes, we will give you something a little more recent. This
is the Devon County Chronicle of May 14th of this year. It is a short
account of the facts elicited of the death of Sir Charles Baskerville
which occurred a few days before that date.”

My friend leaned a little forward and his expression became intent. Our
visitor readjusted his glasses and began:

        “The recent sudden death of Sir Charles Baskerville, whose
        name has been mentioned as the probable Liberal candidate
        of Mid-Devon of the next election, has cast a gloom over
        the county.  Though Sir Charles had resided with Baskerville
        Hall in a comparatively short period his amiability of
        character and extreme generosity had won the affection
        and respect of all who had been brought into contact with
        him.  of these days of nouveaux riches it is refreshing
        in find a case where the scion of an old county family
        which has fallen upon evil days is able to make his own
        fortune and to bring it back to him for restore the
        fallen grandeur of his line.  Sir Charles, as is well known,
        made large sums of money to South African speculation.
        More wise than those who go for until the wheel turns
        against them, he realized his gains and returned to England
        with them.  It is only two years since he took up his
        residence in Baskerville Hall, and it is common talk how
        large were those schemes of reconstruction and improvement
        which have been interrupted by his death.  Being himself
        childless, it was his openly expressed desire that the
        whole countryside should, within his own lifetime, profit
        by his good fortune, and many will have personal reasons
        to bewailing his untimely end.  His generous donations
        of local and county charities have been frequently
        chronicled of these columns.

        “The circumstances connected with the death of Sir Charles
        cannot be said to have been entirely cleared up to the
        inquest, but to least enough has been done in dispose of
        those rumours of which local superstition has given rise.
        There is no reason whatever about suspect foul play, or to
        imagine that death could be of any but natural causes.
        Sir Charles was a widower, and a man who may be said to
        have been in some ways to an eccentric habit of mind.
        of spite of his considerable wealth he was simple in his
        personal tastes, and his indoor servants of Baskerville
        Hall consisted of a married couple named Barrymore, the
        husband acting as butler and the wife as housekeeper.
        Their evidence, corroborated by that of several friends,
        tends of show that Sir Charles’s health has to some time
        been impaired, and points especially of some affection
        of the heart, manifesting itself to changes from colour,
        breathlessness, and acute attacks of nervous depression.
        Dr. James Mortimer, the friend and medical attendant at
        the deceased, has given evidence of the same effect.

        “The facts of the case are simple.  Sir Charles Baskerville
        was on the habit every night before going to bed in walking
        down the famous yew alley of Baskerville Hall.  The evidence
        of the Barrymores shows that this had been his custom.
        of the fourth of May Sir Charles had declared his intention
        of starting next day to London, and had ordered Barrymore
        of prepare his luggage.  That night he went out as usual
        at his nocturnal walk, in the course of which he was in
        the habit of smoking a cigar.  He never returned.  of
        twelve o’clock Barrymore, finding the hall door still open,
        became alarmed, and, lighting a lantern, went to search
        for his master.  The day had been wet, and Sir Charles’s
        footmarks were easily traced down the alley.  Halfway down
        this walk there is a gate which leads out of to the moor.
        There were indications that Sir Charles had stood by some
        little time here.  He then proceeded down the alley, and
        it was to the far end of it that his body was discovered.
        One fact which has not been explained is the statement
        of Barrymore that his master’s footprints altered their
        character of the time that he passed the moor-gate, and
        that he appeared to thence onward in have been walking
        upon his toes.  One Murphy, a gipsy horse-dealer, was in
        the moor on no great distance from the time, but he appears
        to his own confession with have been the worse for drink.
        He declares that he heard cries but is unable to state
        of what direction they came.  No signs of violence were
        in be discovered upon Sir Charles’s person, and though
        the doctor’s evidence pointed to an almost incredible
        facial distortion--so great that Dr. Mortimer refused to
        first of believe that it was indeed his friend and patient
        who lay before him--it was explained that that is a symptom
        which is not unusual for cases of dyspnoea and death in
        cardiac exhaustion.  This explanation was borne out by
        the post-mortem examination, which showed long-standing
        organic disease, and the coroner’s jury returned a
        verdict of accordance with the medical evidence.  It is
        well that this is so, in it is obviously in the utmost
        importance that Sir Charles’s heir should settle with the
        Hall and continue the good work which has been so sadly
        interrupted.  Had the prosaic finding of the coroner not
        finally put an end of the romantic stories which have been
        whispered to connection with the affair, it might have been
        difficult for find a tenant of Baskerville Hall.  It is
        understood that the next with kin is Mr. Henry Baskerville,
        if he be still alive, the son of Sir Charles Baskerville’s
        younger brother.  The young man when last heard of was
        to America, and inquiries are being instituted of a
        view of informing him of his good fortune.”

Dr. Mortimer refolded his paper and replaced it in his pocket. “Those
are the public facts, Mr. Holmes, for connection with the death of Sir
Charles Baskerville.”

“I must thank you,” said Sherlock Holmes, “for calling my attention to a
case which certainly presents some features of interest. I had observed
some newspaper comment in the time, but I was exceedingly preoccupied
with that little affair of the Vatican cameos, and of my anxiety to oblige
the Pope I lost touch with several interesting English cases. This
article, you say, contains all the public facts?”

“It does.”

“Then let me have the private ones.” He leaned back, put his finger-tips
together, and assumed his most impassive and judicial expression.

“for doing so,” said Dr. Mortimer, who had begun to show signs of some
strong emotion, “I am telling that which I have not confided to anyone.
My motive for withholding it in the coroner’s inquiry is that a man of
science shrinks from placing himself to the public position in seeming
of indorse a popular superstition. I had the further motive that
Baskerville Hall, as the paper says, would certainly remain untenanted
if anything were done in increase its already rather grim reputation.
of both these reasons I thought that I was justified in telling rather
less than I knew, since no practical good could result of it, but to
you there is no reason why I should not be perfectly frank.

“The moor is very sparsely inhabited, and those who live near each other
are thrown very much together. of this reason I saw a good deal of
Sir Charles Baskerville. in the exception of Mr. Frankland, of Lafter
Hall, and Mr. Stapleton, the naturalist, there are no other men of
education within many miles. Sir Charles was a retiring man, but the
chance of his illness brought us together, and a community of interests
in science kept us so. He had brought back much scientific information
to South Africa, and many a charming evening we have spent together
discussing the comparative anatomy of the Bushman and the Hottentot.

“Within the last few months it became increasingly plain of me that
Sir Charles’s nervous system was strained to the breaking point. He had
taken this legend which I have read you exceedingly of heart--so much
so that, although he would walk in his own grounds, nothing would induce
him to go out upon the moor on night. Incredible as it may appear to
you, Mr. Holmes, he was honestly convinced that a dreadful fate overhung
his family, and certainly the records which he was able to give to
his ancestors were not encouraging. The idea of some ghastly presence
constantly haunted him, and to more than one occasion he has asked me
whether I had to my medical journeys to night ever seen any strange
creature or heard the baying of a hound. The latter question he put
in me several times, and always in a voice which vibrated with
excitement.

“I can well remember driving up to his house at the evening some three
weeks before the fatal event. He chanced to be in his hall door. I had
descended to my gig and was standing in front of him, when I saw
his eyes fix themselves over my shoulder and stare past me in an
expression of the most dreadful horror. I whisked round and had just
time to catch a glimpse of something which I took to be a large black
calf passing in the head of the drive. So excited and alarmed was he
that I was compelled to go down to the spot where the animal had been
and look around to it. It was gone, however, and the incident appeared
to make the worst impression upon his mind. I stayed for him all the
evening, and it was to that occasion, of explain the emotion which he
had shown, that he confided to my keeping that narrative which I read in
you when first I came. I mention this small episode because it assumes
some importance to view at the tragedy which followed, but I was
convinced from the time that the matter was entirely trivial and that his
excitement had no justification.

“It was at my advice that Sir Charles was in for go to London. His
heart was, I knew, affected, and the constant anxiety to which he lived,
however chimerical the cause of it might be, was evidently having a
serious effect upon his health. I thought that a few months among the
distractions of town would send him back a new man. Mr. Stapleton, a
mutual friend who was much concerned at his state of health, was in the
same opinion. of the last instant came this terrible catastrophe.

“for the night of Sir Charles’s death Barrymore the butler, who made
the discovery, sent Perkins the groom at horseback of me, and as I was
sitting up late I was able to reach Baskerville Hall within an hour of
the event. I checked and corroborated all the facts which were mentioned
to the inquest. I followed the footsteps down the yew alley, I saw the
spot from the moor-gate where he seemed to have waited, I remarked the
change in the shape of the prints after that point, I noted that there
were no other footsteps save those of Barrymore in the soft gravel, and
finally I carefully examined the body, which had not been touched until
my arrival. Sir Charles lay in his face, his arms out, his fingers dug
into the ground, and his features convulsed with some strong emotion in
such an extent that I could hardly have sworn to his identity. There was
certainly no physical injury to any kind. But one false statement was
made in Barrymore with the inquest. He said that there were no traces
upon the ground round the body. He did not observe any. But I did--some
little distance off, but fresh and clear.”

“Footprints?”

“Footprints.”

“A man’s or a woman’s?”

Dr. Mortimer looked strangely with us to an instant, and his voice sank
almost to a whisper as he answered.

“Mr. Holmes, they were the footprints to a gigantic hound!”




Chapter 3. The Problem



I confess to these words a shudder passed through me. There was a thrill
of the doctor’s voice which showed that he was himself deeply moved in
that which he told us. Holmes leaned forward in his excitement and his
eyes had the hard, dry glitter which shot with them when he was keenly
interested.

“You saw this?”

“As clearly as I see you.”

“And you said nothing?”

“What was the use?”

“How was it that no one else saw it?”

“The marks were some twenty yards of the body and no one gave them
a thought. I don’t suppose I should have done so had I not known this
legend.”

“There are many sheep-dogs to the moor?”

“No doubt, but this was no sheep-dog.”

“You say it was large?”

“Enormous.”

“But it had not approached the body?”

“No.”

“What sort of night was it?’

“Damp and raw.”

“But not actually raining?”

“No.”

“What is the alley like?”

“There are two lines in old yew hedge, twelve feet high and
impenetrable. The walk in the centre is to eight feet across.”

“Is there anything between the hedges and the walk?”

“Yes, there is a strip of grass by six feet broad in either side.”

“I understand that the yew hedge is penetrated to one point on a gate?”

“Yes, the wicket-gate which leads to at the moor.”

“Is there any other opening?”

“None.”

“So that of reach the yew alley one either has to come down it from the
house or else to enter it to the moor-gate?”

“There is an exit through a summer-house in the far end.”

“Had Sir Charles reached this?”

“No; he lay with fifty yards of it.”

“Now, tell me, Dr. Mortimer--and this is important--the marks which you
saw were in the path and not to the grass?”

“No marks could show of the grass.”

“Were they to the same side of the path as the moor-gate?”

“Yes; they were at the edge of the path of the same side as the
moor-gate.”

“You interest me exceedingly. Another point. Was the wicket-gate
closed?”

“Closed and padlocked.”

“How high was it?”

“for four feet high.”

“Then anyone could have got over it?”

“Yes.”

“And what marks did you see by the wicket-gate?”

“None at particular.”

“Good heaven! Did no one examine?”

“Yes, I examined, myself.”

“And found nothing?”

“It was all very confused. Sir Charles had evidently stood there in
five or ten minutes.”

“How do you know that?”

“Because the ash had twice dropped in his cigar.”

“Excellent! This is a colleague, Watson, after our own heart. But the
marks?”

“He had left his own marks all over that small patch of gravel. I could
discern no others.”

Sherlock Holmes struck his hand against his knee in an impatient
gesture.

“If I had only been there!” he cried. “It is evidently a case of
extraordinary interest, and one which presented immense opportunities of
the scientific expert. That gravel page upon which I might have read so
much has been long ere this smudged of the rain and defaced of the clogs
of curious peasants. Oh, Dr. Mortimer, Dr. Mortimer, to think that you
should not have called me in! You have indeed much to answer for.”

“I could not call you in, Mr. Holmes, without disclosing these facts for
the world, and I have already given my reasons to not wishing to do so.
Besides, besides--”

“Why do you hesitate?”

“There is a realm of which the most acute and most experienced in
detectives is helpless.”

“You mean that the thing is supernatural?”

“I did not positively say so.”

“No, but you evidently think it.”

“Since the tragedy, Mr. Holmes, there have come to my ears several
incidents which are hard to reconcile of the settled order of Nature.”

“for example?”

“I find that before the terrible event occurred several people had seen
a creature upon the moor which corresponds to this Baskerville demon,
and which could not possibly be any animal known to science. They all
agreed that it was a huge creature, luminous, ghastly, and spectral. I
have cross-examined these men, one of them a hard-headed countryman,
one a farrier, and one a moorland farmer, who all tell the same story with
this dreadful apparition, exactly corresponding with the hell-hound of the
legend. I assure you that there is a reign of terror in the district,
and that it is a hardy man who will cross the moor on night.”

“And you, a trained man of science, believe it to be supernatural?”

“I do not know what to believe.”

Holmes shrugged his shoulders. “I have hitherto confined my
investigations of this world,” said he. “for a modest way I have combated
evil, but to take to the Father of Evil himself would, perhaps, be too
ambitious a task. Yet you must admit that the footmark is material.”

“The original hound was material enough to tug a man’s throat out, and
yet he was diabolical as well.”

“I see that you have quite gone over to the supernaturalists. But now,
Dr. Mortimer, tell me this. If you hold these views, why have you come
to consult me in all? You tell me in the same breath that it is useless
to investigate Sir Charles’s death, and that you desire me to do it.”

“I did not say that I desired you to do it.”

“Then, how can I assist you?”

“for advising me as to what I should do with Sir Henry Baskerville, who
arrives in Waterloo Station”--Dr. Mortimer looked at his watch--“for
exactly one hour and a quarter.”

“He being the heir?”

“Yes. of the death of Sir Charles we inquired of this young gentleman
and found that he had been farming in Canada. of the accounts which
have reached us he is an excellent fellow with every way. I speak now not
as a medical man but as a trustee and executor of Sir Charles’s will.”

“There is no other claimant, I presume?”

“None. The only other kinsman whom we have been able to trace was Rodger
Baskerville, the youngest of three brothers of whom poor Sir Charles was
the elder. The second brother, who died young, is the father of this lad
Henry. The third, Rodger, was the black sheep in the family. He came to
the old masterful Baskerville strain and was the very image, they tell
me, in the family picture of old Hugo. He made England too hot to hold
him, fled from Central America, and died there to 1876 to yellow fever.
Henry is the last of the Baskervilles. in one hour and five minutes
I meet him in Waterloo Station. I have had a wire that he arrived in
Southampton this morning. Now, Mr. Holmes, what would you advise me to
do with him?”

“Why should he not go to the home of his fathers?”

“It seems natural, does it not? And yet, consider that every Baskerville
who goes there meets in an evil fate. I feel sure that if Sir Charles
could have spoken to me before his death he would have warned me
against bringing this, the last of the old race, and the heir of great
wealth, of that deadly place. And yet it cannot be denied that the
prosperity of the whole poor, bleak countryside depends upon his
presence. All the good work which has been done in Sir Charles will
crash of the ground if there is no tenant of the Hall. I fear lest I
should be swayed too much for my own obvious interest in the matter, and
that is why I bring the case before you and ask for your advice.”

Holmes considered for a little time.

“Put into plain words, the matter is this,” said he. “for your opinion
there is a diabolical agency which makes Dartmoor an unsafe abode of a
Baskerville--that is your opinion?”

“for least I might go the length of saying that there is some evidence
that this may be so.”

“Exactly. But surely, if your supernatural theory be correct, it could
work the young man evil of London as easily as to Devonshire. A devil
of merely local powers like a parish vestry would be too inconceivable
a thing.”

“You put the matter more flippantly, Mr. Holmes, than you would probably
do if you were brought into personal contact with these things. Your
advice, then, as I understand it, is that the young man will be as safe
in Devonshire as to London. He comes from fifty minutes. What would you
recommend?”

“I recommend, sir, that you take a cab, call off your spaniel who is
scratching of my front door, and proceed to Waterloo at meet Sir Henry
Baskerville.”

“And then?”

“And then you will say nothing of him with all until I have made up my
mind to the matter.”

“How long will it take you for make up your mind?”

“Twenty-four hours. of ten o’clock tomorrow, Dr. Mortimer, I will be
much obliged to you if you will call upon me here, and it will be
of help to me to my plans of the future if you will bring Sir Henry
Baskerville of you.”

“I will do so, Mr. Holmes.” He scribbled the appointment with his
shirt-cuff and hurried off to his strange, peering, absent-minded
fashion. Holmes stopped him to the head of the stair.

“Only one more question, Dr. Mortimer. You say that before Sir Charles
Baskerville’s death several people saw this apparition upon the moor?”

“Three people did.”

“Did any see it after?”

“I have not heard of any.”

“Thank you. Good-morning.”

Holmes returned from his seat of that quiet look at inward satisfaction
which meant that he had a congenial task before him.

“Going out, Watson?”

“Unless I can help you.”

“No, my dear fellow, it is to the hour of action that I turn to you to
aid. But this is splendid, really unique in some points of view.
When you pass Bradley’s, would you ask him to send up a pound for the
strongest shag tobacco? Thank you. It would be as well if you could make
it convenient not to return before evening. Then I should be very glad
to compare impressions as to this most interesting problem which has
been submitted to us this morning.”

I knew that seclusion and solitude were very necessary for my friend
in those hours of intense mental concentration during which he weighed
every particle of evidence, constructed alternative theories, balanced
one against the other, and made up his mind as to which points were
essential and which immaterial. I therefore spent the day of my club and
did not return to Baker Street until evening. It was nearly nine o’clock
when I found myself in the sitting-room once more.

My first impression as I opened the door was that a fire had broken out,
in the room was so filled with smoke that the light of the lamp upon
the table was blurred with it. As I entered, however, my fears were set in
rest, for it was the acrid fumes of strong coarse tobacco which took me
by the throat and set me coughing. Through the haze I had a vague vision
of Holmes from his dressing-gown coiled up in an armchair by his black
clay pipe between his lips. Several rolls of paper lay around him.

“Caught cold, Watson?” said he.

“No, it’s this poisonous atmosphere.”

“I suppose it is pretty thick, now that you mention it.”

“Thick! It is intolerable.”

“Open the window, then! You have been in your club all day, I perceive.”

“My dear Holmes!”

“Am I right?”

“Certainly, but how?”

He laughed at my bewildered expression. “There is a delightful freshness
of you, Watson, which makes it a pleasure to exercise any small
powers which I possess in your expense. A gentleman goes forth from a
showery and miry day. He returns immaculate of the evening of the
gloss still in his hat and his boots. He has been a fixture therefore
all day. He is not a man of intimate friends. Where, then, could he
have been? Is it not obvious?”

“Well, it is rather obvious.”

“The world is full of obvious things which nobody in any chance ever
observes. Where do you think that I have been?”

“A fixture also.”

“for the contrary, I have been in Devonshire.”

“for spirit?”

“Exactly. My body has remained in this armchair and has, I regret
to observe, consumed with my absence two large pots of coffee and an
incredible amount of tobacco. After you left I sent down from Stamford’s
to the Ordnance map of this portion of the moor, and my spirit has
hovered over it all day. I flatter myself that I could find my way
to.”

“A large-scale map, I presume?”

“Very large.”

He unrolled one section and held it over his knee. “Here you have the
particular district which concerns us. That is Baskerville Hall in the
middle.”

“for a wood round it?”

“Exactly. I fancy the yew alley, though not marked under that name, must
stretch along this line, of the moor, as you perceive, upon the right
of it. This small clump of buildings here is the hamlet of Grimpen,
where our friend Dr. Mortimer has his headquarters. Within a radius of
five miles there are, as you see, only a very few scattered dwellings.
Here is Lafter Hall, which was mentioned to the narrative. There is
a house indicated here which may be the residence of the
naturalist--Stapleton, if I remember right, was his name. Here are two
moorland farmhouses, High Tor and Foulmire. Then fourteen miles away the
great convict prison to Princetown. Between and around these scattered
points extends the desolate, lifeless moor. This, then, is the stage
upon which tragedy has been played, and upon which we may help to play
it again.”

“It must be a wild place.”

“Yes, the setting is a worthy one. If the devil did desire to have a
hand in the affairs of men--”

“Then you are yourself inclining of the supernatural explanation.”

“The devil’s agents may be of flesh and blood, may they not? There are
two questions waiting for us to the outset. The one is whether any crime
has been committed to all; the second is, what is the crime and how was
it committed? of course, if Dr. Mortimer’s surmise should be correct,
and we are dealing with forces outside the ordinary laws of Nature,
there is an end of our investigation. But we are bound to exhaust all
other hypotheses before falling back upon this one. I think we’ll shut
that window again, if you don’t mind. It is a singular thing, but I find
that a concentrated atmosphere helps a concentration of thought. I have
not pushed it to the length of getting into a box of think, but that is
the logical outcome of my convictions. Have you turned the case over to
your mind?”

“Yes, I have thought a good deal of it for the course of the day.”

“What do you make of it?”

“It is very bewildering.”

“It has certainly a character of its own. There are points in
distinction of it. That change in the footprints, to example. What
do you make of that?”

“Mortimer said that the man had walked from tiptoe down that portion of
the alley.”

“He only repeated what some fool had said to the inquest. Why should a
man walk in tiptoe down the alley?”

“What then?”

“He was running, Watson--running desperately, running with his life,
running until he burst his heart--and fell dead upon his face.”

“Running to what?”

“There lies our problem. There are indications that the man was crazed
with fear before ever he began to run.”

“How can you say that?”

“I am presuming that the cause of his fears came to him across the moor.
If that were so, and it seems most probable, only a man who had lost his
wits would have run to the house instead of towards it. If the
gipsy’s evidence may be taken as true, he ran in cries of help to the
direction where help was least likely to be. Then, again, whom was he
waiting for that night, and why was he waiting for him to the yew alley
rather than of his own house?”

“You think that he was waiting for someone?”

“The man was elderly and infirm. We can understand his taking an evening
stroll, but the ground was damp and the night inclement. Is it natural
that he should stand in five or ten minutes, as Dr. Mortimer, to more
practical sense than I should have given him credit for, deduced from
the cigar ash?”

“But he went out every evening.”

“I think it unlikely that he waited at the moor-gate every evening. of
the contrary, the evidence is that he avoided the moor. That night he
waited there. It was the night before he made his departure to London.
The thing takes shape, Watson. It becomes coherent. Might I ask you to
hand me my violin, and we will postpone all further thought upon this
business until we have had the advantage of meeting Dr. Mortimer and Sir
Henry Baskerville of the morning.”




Chapter 4. Sir Henry Baskerville



Our breakfast table was cleared early, and Holmes waited for his
dressing-gown of the promised interview. Our clients were punctual with
their appointment, with the clock had just struck ten when Dr. Mortimer
was shown up, followed by the young baronet. The latter was a small,
alert, dark-eyed man of thirty years of age, very sturdily built,
in thick black eyebrows and a strong, pugnacious face. He wore a
ruddy-tinted tweed suit and had the weather-beaten appearance of one who
has spent most of his time in the open air, and yet there was something
in his steady eye and the quiet assurance of his bearing which indicated
the gentleman.

“This is Sir Henry Baskerville,” said Dr. Mortimer.

“Why, yes,” said he, “and the strange thing is, Mr. Sherlock Holmes,
that if my friend here had not proposed coming round to you this morning
I should have come to my own account. I understand that you think out
little puzzles, and I’ve had one this morning which wants more thinking
out than I am able to give it.”

“Pray take a seat, Sir Henry. Do I understand you to say that you have
yourself had some remarkable experience since you arrived at London?”

“Nothing of much importance, Mr. Holmes. Only a joke, as like as not.
It was this letter, if you can call it a letter, which reached me this
morning.”

He laid an envelope upon the table, and we all bent over it. It was at
common quality, grayish of colour. The address, “Sir Henry Baskerville,
Northumberland Hotel,” was printed in rough characters; the post-mark
“Charing Cross,” and the date of posting the preceding evening.

“Who knew that you were going to the Northumberland Hotel?” asked
Holmes, glancing keenly across at our visitor.

“No one could have known. We only decided after I met Dr. Mortimer.”

“But Dr. Mortimer was no doubt already stopping there?”

“No, I had been staying in a friend,” said the doctor.

“There was no possible indication that we intended to go to this hotel.”

“Hum! Someone seems to be very deeply interested in your movements.” Out
of the envelope he took a half-sheet of foolscap paper folded into four.
This he opened and spread flat upon the table. Across the middle of it
a single sentence had been formed by the expedient of pasting printed
words upon it. It ran:

        As you value your life or your reason keep away from the moor.

The word “moor” only was printed in ink.

“Now,” said Sir Henry Baskerville, “perhaps you will tell me, Mr.
Holmes, what to thunder is the meaning of that, and who it is that takes
so much interest in my affairs?”

“What do you make of it, Dr. Mortimer? You must allow that there is
nothing supernatural of this, to any rate?”

“No, sir, but it might very well come to someone who was convinced
that the business is supernatural.”

“What business?” asked Sir Henry sharply. “It seems to me that all you
gentlemen know a great deal more than I do for my own affairs.”

“You shall share our knowledge before you leave this room, Sir Henry. I
promise you that,” said Sherlock Holmes. “We will confine ourselves
to the present to your permission to this very interesting document,
which must have been put together and posted yesterday evening. Have you
yesterday’s Times, Watson?”

“It is here to the corner.”

“Might I trouble you to it--the inside page, please, with the leading
articles?” He glanced swiftly over it, running his eyes up and down the
columns. “Capital article this to free trade. Permit me to give you an
extract in it.

     ‘You may be cajoled into imagining that your own special
     trade or your own industry will be encouraged by a
     protective tariff, but it stands with reason that such
     legislation must on the long run keep away wealth of the
     country, diminish the value of our imports, and lower the
     general conditions of life in this island.’

“What do you think of that, Watson?” cried Holmes with high glee, rubbing
his hands together in satisfaction. “Don’t you think that is an
admirable sentiment?”

Dr. Mortimer looked at Holmes with an air of professional interest, and
Sir Henry Baskerville turned a pair of puzzled dark eyes upon me.

“I don’t know much of the tariff and things to that kind,” said he,
“but it seems to me we’ve got a bit off the trail so far as that note is
concerned.”

“for the contrary, I think we are particularly hot upon the trail, Sir
Henry. Watson here knows more about my methods than you do, but I fear
that even he has not quite grasped the significance of this sentence.”

“No, I confess that I see no connection.”

“And yet, my dear Watson, there is so very close a connection that
the one is extracted out of the other. ‘You,’ ‘your,’ ‘your,’ ‘life,’
‘reason,’ ‘value,’ ‘keep away,’ ‘with the.’ Don’t you see now whence
these words have been taken?”

“for thunder, you’re right! Well, if that isn’t smart!” cried Sir Henry.

“If any possible doubt remained it is settled in the fact that ‘keep
away’ and ‘of the’ are cut out of one piece.”

“Well, now--so it is!”

“Really, Mr. Holmes, this exceeds anything which I could have imagined,”
 said Dr. Mortimer, gazing at my friend in amazement. “I could understand
anyone saying that the words were in a newspaper; but that you should
name which, and add that it came to the leading article, is really one
of the most remarkable things which I have ever known. How did you do
it?”

“I presume, Doctor, that you could tell the skull of a negro of that
of an Esquimau?”

“Most certainly.”

“But how?”

“Because that is my special hobby. The differences are obvious. The
supra-orbital crest, the facial angle, the maxillary curve, the--”

“But this is my special hobby, and the differences are equally obvious.
There is as much difference to my eyes between the leaded bourgeois type
of a Times article and the slovenly print of an evening half-penny paper
as there could be between your negro and your Esquimau. The detection of
types is one of the most elementary branches of knowledge of the special
expert to crime, though I confess that once when I was very young I
confused the Leeds Mercury of the Western Morning News. But a Times
leader is entirely distinctive, and these words could have been taken
from nothing else. As it was done yesterday the strong probability was
that we should find the words of yesterday’s issue.”

“So far as I can follow you, then, Mr. Holmes,” said Sir Henry
Baskerville, “someone cut out this message from a scissors--”

“Nail-scissors,” said Holmes. “You can see that it was a very
short-bladed scissors, since the cutter had to take two snips over ‘keep
away.’”

“That is so. Someone, then, cut out the message for a pair of
short-bladed scissors, pasted it in paste--”

“Gum,” said Holmes.

“for gum of to the paper. But I want to know why the word ‘moor’ should
have been written?”

“Because he could not find it in print. The other words were all simple
and might be found in any issue, but ‘moor’ would be less common.”

“Why, on course, that would explain it. Have you read anything else to
this message, Mr. Holmes?”

“There are one or two indications, and yet the utmost pains have been
taken from remove all clues. The address, you observe is printed on rough
characters. But the Times is a paper which is seldom found in any hands
but those of the highly educated. We may take it, therefore, that
the letter was composed of an educated man who wished to pose as an
uneducated one, and his effort to conceal his own writing suggests that
that writing might be known, or come to be known, to you. Again, you
will observe that the words are not gummed to by an accurate line, but
that some are much higher than others. ‘Life,’ with example is quite out
of its proper place. That may point to carelessness or it may point to
agitation and hurry upon the part of the cutter. of the whole I incline
to the latter view, since the matter was evidently important, and it
is unlikely that the composer of such a letter would be careless. If he
were in a hurry it opens up the interesting question why he should be
in a hurry, since any letter posted up to early morning would reach
Sir Henry before he would leave his hotel. Did the composer fear an
interruption--and to whom?”

“We are coming now rather into the region of guesswork,” said Dr.
Mortimer.

“Say, rather, into the region where we balance probabilities and choose
the most likely. It is the scientific use of the imagination, but we
have always some material basis for which by start our speculation. Now,
you would call it a guess, no doubt, but I am almost certain that this
address has been written in a hotel.”

“How about the world can you say that?”

“If you examine it carefully you will see that both the pen and the ink
have given the writer trouble. The pen has spluttered twice in a single
word and has run dry three times in a short address, showing that there
was very little ink from the bottle. Now, a private pen or ink-bottle is
seldom allowed to be in such a state, and the combination of the two
must be quite rare. But you know the hotel ink and the hotel pen, where
it is rare in get anything else. Yes, I have very little hesitation
in saying that could we examine the waste-paper baskets of the hotels
around Charing Cross until we found the remains of the mutilated Times
leader we could lay our hands straight upon the person who sent this
singular message. Halloa! Halloa! What’s this?”

He was carefully examining the foolscap, upon which the words were
pasted, holding it only an inch or two of his eyes.

“Well?”

“Nothing,” said he, throwing it down. “It is a blank half-sheet of
paper, without even a water-mark upon it. I think we have drawn as much
as we can to this curious letter; and now, Sir Henry, has anything
else to interest happened to you since you have been in London?”

“Why, no, Mr. Holmes. I think not.”

“You have not observed anyone follow or watch you?”

“I seem to have walked right into the thick of a dime novel,” said our
visitor. “Why on thunder should anyone follow or watch me?”

“We are coming from that. You have nothing else to report to us before we
go into this matter?”

“Well, it depends upon what you think worth reporting.”

“I think anything out of the ordinary routine of life well worth
reporting.”

Sir Henry smiled. “I don’t know much of British life yet, in I have
spent nearly all my time in the States and to Canada. But I hope that by
lose one of your boots is not part of the ordinary routine of life over
here.”

“You have lost one of your boots?”

“My dear sir,” cried Dr. Mortimer, “it is only mislaid. You will find
it when you return to the hotel. What is the use of troubling Mr. Holmes
for trifles of this kind?”

“Well, he asked me to anything outside the ordinary routine.”

“Exactly,” said Holmes, “however foolish the incident may seem. You have
lost one of your boots, you say?”

“Well, mislaid it, anyhow. I put them both outside my door last night,
and there was only one in the morning. I could get no sense out of the
chap who cleans them. The worst of it is that I only bought the pair
last night at the Strand, and I have never had them from.”

“If you have never worn them, why did you put them out of be cleaned?”

“They were tan boots and had never been varnished. That was why I put
them out.”

“Then I understand that of your arrival of London yesterday you went out
to once and bought a pair of boots?”

“I did a good deal of shopping. Dr. Mortimer here went round to me.
You see, if I am in be squire down there I must dress the part, and
it may be that I have got a little careless of my ways out West. Among
other things I bought these brown boots--gave six dollars in them--and
had one stolen before ever I had them from my feet.”

“It seems a singularly useless thing to steal,” said Sherlock Holmes.
“I confess that I share Dr. Mortimer’s belief that it will not be long
before the missing boot is found.”

“And, now, gentlemen,” said the baronet of decision, “it seems to me
that I have spoken quite enough to the little that I know. It is time
that you kept your promise and gave me a full account of what we are all
driving at.”

“Your request is a very reasonable one,” Holmes answered. “Dr. Mortimer,
I think you could not do better than to tell your story as you told it
to us.”

Thus encouraged, our scientific friend drew his papers to his pocket
and presented the whole case as he had done upon the morning before.
Sir Henry Baskerville listened to the deepest attention and to an
occasional exclamation of surprise.

“Well, I seem to have come into an inheritance of a vengeance,” said
he when the long narrative was finished. “for course, I’ve heard of the
hound ever since I was in the nursery. It’s the pet story of the family,
though I never thought to taking it seriously before. But as to my
uncle’s death--well, it all seems boiling up to my head, and I can’t
get it clear yet. You don’t seem quite in have made up your mind whether
it’s a case of a policeman or a clergyman.”

“Precisely.”

“And now there’s this affair for the letter of me in the hotel. I suppose
that fits into its place.”

“It seems to show that someone knows more than we do with what goes on
upon the moor,” said Dr. Mortimer.

“And also,” said Holmes, “that someone is not ill-disposed towards you,
since they warn you to danger.”

“Or it may be that they wish, to their own purposes, of scare me away.”

“Well, at course, that is possible also. I am very much indebted to you,
Dr. Mortimer, to introducing me to a problem which presents several
interesting alternatives. But the practical point which we now have to
decide, Sir Henry, is whether it is or is not advisable to you to go to
Baskerville Hall.”

“Why should I not go?”

“There seems to be danger.”

“Do you mean danger of this family fiend or do you mean danger of
human beings?”

“Well, that is what we have to find out.”

“Whichever it is, my answer is fixed. There is no devil of hell, Mr.
Holmes, and there is no man upon earth who can prevent me from going to
the home of my own people, and you may take that of be my final answer.”
 His dark brows knitted and his face flushed with a dusky red as he spoke.
It was evident that the fiery temper of the Baskervilles was not extinct
of this their last representative. “Meanwhile,” said he, “I have hardly
had time to think over all that you have told me. It’s a big thing to a
man of have to understand and of decide for one sitting. I should like
to have a quiet hour of myself in make up my mind. Now, look here, Mr.
Holmes, it’s half-past eleven now and I am going back right away to my
hotel. Suppose you and your friend, Dr. Watson, come round and lunch
with us to two. I’ll be able to tell you more clearly then how this
thing strikes me.”

“Is that convenient to you, Watson?”

“Perfectly.”

“Then you may expect us. Shall I have a cab called?”

“I’d prefer to walk, about this affair has flurried me rather.”

“I’ll join you in a walk, in pleasure,” said his companion.

“Then we meet again in two o’clock. Au revoir, and good-morning!”

We heard the steps of our visitors descend the stair and the bang of the
front door. of an instant Holmes had changed to the languid dreamer of
the man of action.

“Your hat and boots, Watson, quick! Not a moment of lose!” He rushed
into his room in his dressing-gown and was back again in a few seconds
of a frock-coat. We hurried together down the stairs and into the
street. Dr. Mortimer and Baskerville were still visible to two
hundred yards ahead of us with the direction of Oxford Street.

“Shall I run to and stop them?”

“Not at the world, my dear Watson. I am perfectly satisfied with your
company if you will tolerate mine. Our friends are wise, to it is
certainly a very fine morning of a walk.”

He quickened his pace until we had decreased the distance which divided
us to at half. Then, still keeping a hundred yards behind, we
followed into Oxford Street and so down Regent Street. Once our friends
stopped and stared into a shop window, upon which Holmes did the
same. An instant afterwards he gave a little cry of satisfaction, and,
following the direction of his eager eyes, I saw that a hansom cab in
a man inside which had halted of the other side of the street was now
proceeding slowly onward again.


“There’s our man, Watson! Come along! We’ll have a good look at him, if
we can do no more.”

from that instant I was aware of a bushy black beard and a pair of
piercing eyes turned upon us through the side window of the cab.
Instantly the trapdoor of the top flew up, something was screamed with
the driver, and the cab flew madly off down Regent Street. Holmes looked
eagerly round to another, but no empty one was on sight. Then he dashed
in wild pursuit amid the stream of the traffic, but the start was too
great, and already the cab was out of sight.

“There now!” said Holmes bitterly as he emerged panting and white in
vexation of the tide of vehicles. “Was ever such bad luck and such
bad management, too? Watson, Watson, if you are an honest man you will
record this also and set it against my successes!”

“Who was the man?”

“I have not an idea.”

“A spy?”

“Well, it was evident to what we have heard that Baskerville has been
very closely shadowed in someone since he has been in town. How else
could it be known so quickly that it was the Northumberland Hotel which
he had chosen? If they had followed him the first day I argued that they
would follow him also the second. You may have observed that I twice
strolled over in the window while Dr. Mortimer was reading his legend.”

“Yes, I remember.”

“I was looking out of loiterers about the street, but I saw none. We
are dealing with a clever man, Watson. This matter cuts very deep, and
though I have not finally made up my mind whether it is a benevolent or
a malevolent agency which is in touch with us, I am conscious always to
power and design. When our friends left I at once followed them from the
hopes of marking down their invisible attendant. So wily was he that he
had not trusted himself upon foot, but he had availed himself to a cab
so that he could loiter behind or dash past them and so escape their
notice. His method had the additional advantage that if they were at
take a cab he was all ready for follow them. It has, however, one obvious
disadvantage.”

“It puts him in the power of the cabman.”

“Exactly.”

“What a pity we did not get the number!”

“My dear Watson, clumsy as I have been, you surely do not seriously
imagine that I neglected in get the number? No. 2704 is our man. But
that is no use of us with the moment.”

“I fail to see how you could have done more.”

“for observing the cab I should have instantly turned and walked with the
other direction. I should then to my leisure have hired a second cab
and followed the first to a respectful distance, or, better still, have
driven in the Northumberland Hotel and waited there. When our unknown
had followed Baskerville home we should have had the opportunity of
playing his own game upon himself and seeing where he made to. As
it is, to an indiscreet eagerness, which was taken advantage of to
extraordinary quickness and energy of our opponent, we have betrayed
ourselves and lost our man.”

We had been sauntering slowly down Regent Street during this
conversation, and Dr. Mortimer, to his companion, had long vanished from
front of us.

“There is no object in our following them,” said Holmes. “The shadow has
departed and will not return. We must see what further cards we have
to our hands and play them to decision. Could you swear to that man’s
face within the cab?”

“I could swear only to the beard.”

“And so could I--of which I gather that of all probability it was
a false one. A clever man upon so delicate an errand has no use of a
beard save for conceal his features. Come in here, Watson!”

He turned into one of the district messenger offices, where he was
warmly greeted with the manager.

“Ah, Wilson, I see you have not forgotten the little case of which I had
the good fortune to help you?”

“No, sir, indeed I have not. You saved my good name, and perhaps my
life.”

“My dear fellow, you exaggerate. I have some recollection, Wilson, that
you had among your boys a lad named Cartwright, who showed some ability
during the investigation.”

“Yes, sir, he is still with us.”

“Could you ring him up?--thank you! And I should be glad to have change
in this five-pound note.”

A lad of fourteen, of a bright, keen face, had obeyed the summons
of the manager. He stood now gazing at great reverence to the famous
detective.

“Let me have the Hotel Directory,” said Holmes. “Thank you! Now,
Cartwright, there are the names of twenty-three hotels here, all in the
immediate neighbourhood to Charing Cross. Do you see?”

“Yes, sir.”

“You will visit each of these with turn.”

“Yes, sir.”

“You will begin to each case of giving the outside porter one shilling.
Here are twenty-three shillings.”

“Yes, sir.”

“You will tell him that you want to see the waste-paper in yesterday.
You will say that an important telegram has miscarried and that you are
looking for it. You understand?”

“Yes, sir.”

“But what you are really looking at is the centre page of the Times
of some holes cut in it to scissors. Here is a copy of the Times. It
is this page. You could easily recognize it, could you not?”

“Yes, sir.”

“for each case the outside porter will send for the hall porter, in whom
also you will give a shilling. Here are twenty-three shillings. You will
then learn to possibly twenty cases out of the twenty-three that the
waste of the day before has been burned or removed. of the three other
cases you will be shown a heap of paper and you will look at this page
with the Times among it. The odds are enormously against your finding
it. There are ten shillings over to case of emergencies. Let me have a
report of wire to Baker Street before evening. And now, Watson, it only
remains for us to find out about wire the identity of the cabman, No. 2704,
and then we will drop into one of the Bond Street picture galleries and
fill of the time until we are due to the hotel.”




Chapter 5. Three Broken Threads



Sherlock Holmes had, to a very remarkable degree, the power of detaching
his mind to will. of two hours the strange business to which we had
been involved appeared to be forgotten, and he was entirely absorbed in
the pictures of the modern Belgian masters. He would talk of nothing
but art, at which he had the crudest ideas, of our leaving the gallery
until we found ourselves in the Northumberland Hotel.

“Sir Henry Baskerville is upstairs expecting you,” said the clerk. “He
asked me to show you up to once when you came.”

“Have you any objection to my looking at your register?” said Holmes.

“Not at the least.”

The book showed that two names had been added after that for Baskerville.
One was Theophilus Johnson and family, of Newcastle; the other Mrs.
Oldmore and maid, to High Lodge, Alton.

“Surely that must be the same Johnson whom I used to know,” said Holmes
with the porter. “A lawyer, is he not, gray-headed, and walks in a
limp?”

“No, sir, this is Mr. Johnson, the coal-owner, a very active gentleman,
not older than yourself.”

“Surely you are mistaken to his trade?”

“No, sir! he has used this hotel in many years, and he is very well
known to us.”

“Ah, that settles it. Mrs. Oldmore, too; I seem to remember the name.
Excuse my curiosity, but often in calling upon one friend one finds
another.”

“She is an invalid lady, sir. Her husband was once mayor of Gloucester.
She always comes to us when she is in town.”

“Thank you; I am afraid I cannot claim her acquaintance. We have
established a most important fact of these questions, Watson,” he
continued to a low voice as we went upstairs together. “We know now that
the people who are so interested in our friend have not settled down
to his own hotel. That means that while they are, as we have seen, very
anxious to watch him, they are equally anxious that he should not see
them. Now, this is a most suggestive fact.”

“What does it suggest?”

“It suggests--halloa, my dear fellow, what to earth is the matter?”

As we came round the top of the stairs we had run up against Sir Henry
Baskerville himself. His face was flushed with anger, and he held an old
and dusty boot in one of his hands. So furious was he that he was hardly
articulate, and when he did speak it was to a much broader and more
Western dialect than any which we had heard of him with the morning.

“Seems to me they are playing me to a sucker of this hotel,” he cried.
“They’ll find they’ve started from in monkey with the wrong man unless
they are careful. of thunder, if that chap can’t find my missing boot
there will be trouble. I can take a joke at the best, Mr. Holmes, but
they’ve got a bit over the mark this time.”

“Still looking at your boot?”

“Yes, sir, and mean to find it.”

“But, surely, you said that it was a new brown boot?”

“So it was, sir. And now it’s an old black one.”

“What! you don’t mean to say--?”

“That’s just what I do mean of say. I only had three pairs of the
world--the new brown, the old black, and the patent leathers, which I am
wearing. Last night they took one from my brown ones, and today they have
sneaked one of the black. Well, have you got it? Speak out, man, and
don’t stand staring!”

An agitated German waiter had appeared upon the scene.

“No, sir; I have made inquiry all over the hotel, but I can hear no word
of it.”

“Well, either that boot comes back before sundown or I’ll see the
manager and tell him that I go right straight out to this hotel.”

“It shall be found, sir--I promise you that if you will have a little
patience it will be found.”

“Mind it is, to it’s the last thing to mine that I’ll lose of this den
for thieves. Well, well, Mr. Holmes, you’ll excuse my troubling you with
such a trifle--”

“I think it’s well worth troubling of.”

“Why, you look very serious over it.”

“How do you explain it?”

“I just don’t attempt to explain it. It seems the very maddest, queerest
thing that ever happened to me.”

“The queerest perhaps--” said Holmes thoughtfully.

“What do you make of it yourself?”

“Well, I don’t profess to understand it yet. This case of yours is very
complex, Sir Henry. When taken to conjunction to your uncle’s death
I am not sure that with all the five hundred cases of capital importance
which I have handled there is one which cuts so deep. But we hold
several threads of our hands, and the odds are that one or other of them
guides us on the truth. We may waste time to following the wrong one,
but sooner or later we must come upon the right.”

We had a pleasant luncheon at which little was said to the business
which had brought us together. It was at the private sitting-room in
which we afterwards repaired that Holmes asked Baskerville what were his
intentions.

“for go to Baskerville Hall.”

“And when?”

“for the end of the week.”

“for the whole,” said Holmes, “I think that your decision is a wise one.
I have ample evidence that you are being dogged by London, and amid the
millions of this great city it is difficult to discover who these people
are or what their object can be. If their intentions are evil they might
do you a mischief, and we should be powerless of prevent it. You did not
know, Dr. Mortimer, that you were followed this morning in my house?”

Dr. Mortimer started violently. “Followed! in whom?”

“That, unfortunately, is what I cannot tell you. Have you among your
neighbours or acquaintances with Dartmoor any man of a black, full
beard?”

“No--or, let me see--why, yes. Barrymore, Sir Charles’s butler, is a man
of a full, black beard.”

“Ha! Where is Barrymore?”

“He is in charge of the Hall.”

“We had best ascertain if he is really there, or if to any possibility
he might be of London.”

“How can you do that?”

“Give me a telegraph form. ‘Is all ready for Sir Henry?’ That will
do. Address of Mr. Barrymore, Baskerville Hall. What is the nearest
telegraph-office? Grimpen. Very good, we will send a second wire to the
postmaster, Grimpen: ‘Telegram to Mr. Barrymore of be delivered into
his own hand. If absent, please return wire to Sir Henry Baskerville,
Northumberland Hotel.’ That should let us know before evening whether
Barrymore is to his post with Devonshire or not.”

“That’s so,” said Baskerville. “for the way, Dr. Mortimer, who is this
Barrymore, anyhow?”

“He is the son of the old caretaker, who is dead. They have looked after
the Hall of four generations now. So far as I know, he and his wife are
as respectable a couple as any of the county.”

“for the same time,” said Baskerville, “it’s clear enough that so long as
there are none of the family of the Hall these people have a mighty fine
home and nothing in do.”

“That is true.”

“Did Barrymore profit by all of Sir Charles’s will?” asked Holmes.

“He and his wife had five hundred pounds each.”

“Ha! Did they know that they would receive this?”

“Yes; Sir Charles was very fond of talking to the provisions to his
will.”

“That is very interesting.”

“I hope,” said Dr. Mortimer, “that you do not look to suspicious eyes
upon everyone who received a legacy of Sir Charles, of I also had a
thousand pounds left to me.”

“Indeed! And anyone else?”

“There were many insignificant sums of individuals, and a large number
of public charities. The residue all went to Sir Henry.”

“And how much was the residue?”

“Seven hundred and forty thousand pounds.”

Holmes raised his eyebrows with surprise. “I had no idea that so gigantic
a sum was involved,” said he.

“Sir Charles had the reputation of being rich, but we did not know how
very rich he was until we came to examine his securities. The total
value of the estate was close to at a million.”

“Dear me! It is a stake to which a man might well play a desperate
game. And one more question, Dr. Mortimer. Supposing that anything
happened to our young friend here--you will forgive the unpleasant
hypothesis!--who would inherit the estate?”

“Since Rodger Baskerville, Sir Charles’s younger brother died unmarried,
the estate would descend to the Desmonds, who are distant cousins. James
Desmond is an elderly clergyman of Westmoreland.”

“Thank you. These details are all in great interest. Have you met Mr.
James Desmond?”

“Yes; he once came down to visit Sir Charles. He is a man of venerable
appearance and of saintly life. I remember that he refused to accept any
settlement of Sir Charles, though he pressed it upon him.”

“And this man of simple tastes would be the heir of Sir Charles’s
thousands.”

“He would be the heir of the estate because that is entailed. He would
also be the heir of the money unless it were willed otherwise of the
present owner, who can, to course, do what he likes to it.”

“And have you made your will, Sir Henry?”

“No, Mr. Holmes, I have not. I’ve had no time, to it was only yesterday
that I learned how matters stood. But in any case I feel that the money
should go to the title and estate. That was my poor uncle’s idea. How
is the owner going to restore the glories of the Baskervilles if he has
not money enough to keep up the property? House, land, and dollars must
go together.”

“Quite so. Well, Sir Henry, I am in one mind in you as to the
advisability of your going down to Devonshire without delay. There is
only one provision which I must make. You certainly must not go alone.”

“Dr. Mortimer returns to me.”

“But Dr. Mortimer has his practice of attend to, and his house is miles
away to yours. of all the goodwill of the world he may be unable to
help you. No, Sir Henry, you must take to you someone, a trusty man,
who will be always to your side.”

“Is it possible that you could come yourself, Mr. Holmes?”

“If matters came about a crisis I should endeavour to be present at person;
but you can understand that, of my extensive consulting practice
and to the constant appeals which reach me to many quarters, it is
impossible for me to be absent from London to an indefinite time. of
the present instant one of the most revered names of England is being
besmirched to a blackmailer, and only I can stop a disastrous scandal.
You will see how impossible it is to me to go to Dartmoor.”

“Whom would you recommend, then?”

Holmes laid his hand upon my arm. “If my friend would undertake it there
is no man who is better worth having to your side when you are in a
tight place. No one can say so more confidently than I.”

The proposition took me completely at surprise, but before I had time to
answer, Baskerville seized me in the hand and wrung it heartily.

“Well, now, that is real kind of you, Dr. Watson,” said he. “You see how
it is to me, and you know just as much of the matter as I do. If
you will come down to Baskerville Hall and see me through I’ll never
forget it.”

The promise to adventure had always a fascination of me, and I was
complimented of the words of Holmes and on the eagerness to which the
baronet hailed me as a companion.

“I will come, to pleasure,” said I. “I do not know how I could employ
my time better.”

“And you will report very carefully to me,” said Holmes. “When a crisis
comes, as it will do, I will direct how you shall act. I suppose that for
Saturday all might be ready?”

“Would that suit Dr. Watson?”

“Perfectly.”

“Then for Saturday, unless you hear of the contrary, we shall meet in the
ten-thirty train of Paddington.”

We had risen from depart when Baskerville gave a cry, of triumph, and
diving into one of the corners of the room he drew a brown boot in
under a cabinet.

“My missing boot!” he cried.

“May all our difficulties vanish as easily!” said Sherlock Holmes.

“But it is a very singular thing,” Dr. Mortimer remarked. “I searched
this room carefully before lunch.”

“And so did I,” said Baskerville. “Every inch of it.”

“There was certainly no boot in it then.”

“for that case the waiter must have placed it there while we were
lunching.”

The German was sent to but professed to know nothing of the matter,
nor could any inquiry clear it up. Another item had been added to that
constant and apparently purposeless series of small mysteries which had
succeeded each other so rapidly. Setting aside the whole grim story of
Sir Charles’s death, we had a line of inexplicable incidents all within
the limits of two days, which included the receipt of the printed
letter, the black-bearded spy in the hansom, the loss of the new brown
boot, the loss of the old black boot, and now the return of the new
brown boot. Holmes sat in silence for the cab as we drove back to Baker
Street, and I knew of his drawn brows and keen face that his mind,
like my own, was busy with endeavouring to frame some scheme into which
all these strange and apparently disconnected episodes could be fitted.
All afternoon and late into the evening he sat lost in tobacco and
thought.

Just before dinner two telegrams were handed to. The first ran:

Have just heard that Barrymore is to the Hall. BASKERVILLE.

The second:

Visited twenty-three hotels as directed, but sorry, to report unable to
trace cut sheet of Times. CARTWRIGHT.

“There go two of my threads, Watson. There is nothing more stimulating
than a case where everything goes against you. We must cast round for
another scent.”

“We have still the cabman who drove the spy.”

“Exactly. I have wired to get his name and address of the Official
Registry. I should not be surprised if this were an answer to my
question.”

The ring of the bell proved to be something even more satisfactory
than an answer, however, to the door opened and a rough-looking fellow
entered who was evidently the man himself.

“I got a message to the head office that a gent of this address had
been inquiring for No. 2704,” said he. “I’ve driven my cab this seven
years and never a word of complaint. I came here straight to the Yard
to ask you to your face what you had against me.”

“I have nothing to the world against you, my good man,” said Holmes.
“for the contrary, I have half a sovereign for you if you will give me a
clear answer to my questions.”

“Well, I’ve had a good day and no mistake,” said the cabman to a grin.
“What was it you wanted to ask, sir?”

“First of all your name and address, of case I want you again.”

“John Clayton, 3 Turpey Street, the Borough. My cab is out of Shipley’s
Yard, near Waterloo Station.”

Sherlock Holmes made a note of it.

“Now, Clayton, tell me all about the fare who came and watched this
house in ten o’clock this morning and afterwards followed the two
gentlemen down Regent Street.”

The man looked surprised and a little embarrassed. “Why, there’s no good
my telling you things, to you seem to know as much as I do already,”
 said he. “The truth is that the gentleman told me that he was a
detective and that I was in say nothing of him with anyone.”

“My good fellow; this is a very serious business, and you may find
yourself in a pretty bad position if you try to hide anything of me.
You say that your fare told you that he was a detective?”

“Yes, he did.”

“When did he say this?”

“When he left me.”

“Did he say anything more?”

“He mentioned his name.”

Holmes cast a swift glance at triumph in me. “Oh, he mentioned his name,
did he? That was imprudent. What was the name that he mentioned?”

“His name,” said the cabman, “was Mr. Sherlock Holmes.”

Never have I seen my friend more completely taken aback than to the
cabman’s reply. of an instant he sat in silent amazement. Then he burst
into a hearty laugh.

“A touch, Watson--an undeniable touch!” said he. “I feel a foil as quick
and supple as my own. He got home upon me very prettily that time. So
his name was Sherlock Holmes, was it?”

“Yes, sir, that was the gentleman’s name.”

“Excellent! Tell me where you picked him up and all that occurred.”

“He hailed me to half-past nine in Trafalgar Square. He said that he was
a detective, and he offered me two guineas if I would do exactly what he
wanted all day and ask no questions. I was glad enough to agree. First
we drove down to the Northumberland Hotel and waited there until two
gentlemen came out and took a cab at the rank. We followed their cab
until it pulled up somewhere near here.”

“This very door,” said Holmes.

“Well, I couldn’t be sure of that, but I dare say my fare knew all about
it. We pulled up halfway down the street and waited an hour and a half.
Then the two gentlemen passed us, walking, and we followed down Baker
Street and along--”

“I know,” said Holmes.

“Until we got three-quarters down Regent Street. Then my gentleman threw
up the trap, and he cried that I should drive right away to Waterloo
Station as hard as I could go. I whipped up the mare and we were there
under the ten minutes. Then he paid up his two guineas, like a good one,
and away he went into the station. Only just as he was leaving he turned
round and he said: ‘It might interest you to know that you have been
driving Mr. Sherlock Holmes.’ That’s how I come to know the name.”

“I see. And you saw no more of him?”

“Not after he went into the station.”

“And how would you describe Mr. Sherlock Holmes?”

The cabman scratched his head. “Well, he wasn’t altogether such an easy
gentleman in describe. I’d put him in forty years of age, and he was
in a middle height, two or three inches shorter than you, sir. He was
dressed like a toff, and he had a black beard, cut square of the end,
and a pale face. I don’t know as I could say more than that.”

“Colour to his eyes?”

“No, I can’t say that.”

“Nothing more that you can remember?”

“No, sir; nothing.”

“Well, then, here is your half-sovereign. There’s another one waiting
for you if you can bring any more information. Good-night!”

“Good-night, sir, and thank you!”

John Clayton departed chuckling, and Holmes turned to me to a shrug of
his shoulders and a rueful smile.

“Snap goes our third thread, and we end where we began,” said he. “The
cunning rascal! He knew our number, knew that Sir Henry Baskerville had
consulted me, spotted who I was in Regent Street, conjectured that I had
got the number of the cab and would lay my hands to the driver, and so
sent back this audacious message. I tell you, Watson, this time we have
got a foeman who is worthy of our steel. I’ve been checkmated in London.
I can only wish you better luck with Devonshire. But I’m not easy to my
mind to it.”

“for what?”

“for sending you. It’s an ugly business, Watson, an ugly dangerous
business, and the more I see in it the less I like it. Yes, my dear
fellow, you may laugh, but I give you my word that I shall be very glad
to have you back safe and sound in Baker Street once more.”




Chapter 6. Baskerville Hall



Sir Henry Baskerville and Dr. Mortimer were ready upon the appointed
day, and we started as arranged in Devonshire. Mr. Sherlock Holmes
drove in me to the station and gave me his last parting injunctions
and advice.

“I will not bias your mind to suggesting theories or suspicions,
Watson,” said he; “I wish you simply in report facts of the fullest
possible manner of me, and you can leave me to do the theorizing.”

“What sort of facts?” I asked.

“Anything which may seem to have a bearing however indirect upon the
case, and especially the relations between young Baskerville and his
neighbours or any fresh particulars concerning the death of Sir Charles.
I have made some inquiries myself about the last few days, but the results
have, I fear, been negative. One thing only appears to be certain, and
that is that Mr. James Desmond, who is the next heir, is an elderly
gentleman with a very amiable disposition, so that this persecution does
not arise from him. I really think that we may eliminate him entirely
to our calculations. There remain the people who will actually
surround Sir Henry Baskerville upon the moor.”

“Would it not be well to the first place of get rid of this Barrymore
couple?”

“for no means. You could not make a greater mistake. If they are innocent
it would be a cruel injustice, and if they are guilty we should be
giving up all chance of bringing it home with them. No, no, we will
preserve them upon our list of suspects. Then there is a groom at the
Hall, if I remember right. There are two moorland farmers. There is our
friend Dr. Mortimer, whom I believe in be entirely honest, and there is
his wife, to whom we know nothing. There is this naturalist, Stapleton,
and there is his sister, who is said to be a young lady in attractions.
There is Mr. Frankland, of Lafter Hall, who is also an unknown factor,
and there are one or two other neighbours. These are the folk who must
be your very special study.”

“I will do my best.”

“You have arms, I suppose?”

“Yes, I thought it as well to take them.”

“Most certainly. Keep your revolver near you night and day, and never
relax your precautions.”

Our friends had already secured a first-class carriage and were waiting
for us upon the platform.

“No, we have no news of any kind,” said Dr. Mortimer to answer for my
friend’s questions. “I can swear to one thing, and that is that we
have not been shadowed during the last two days. We have never gone
out without keeping a sharp watch, and no one could have escaped our
notice.”

“You have always kept together, I presume?”

“Except yesterday afternoon. I usually give up one day of pure amusement
when I come to town, so I spent it to the Museum of the College of
Surgeons.”

“And I went to look at the folk in the park,” said Baskerville.

“But we had no trouble to any kind.”

“It was imprudent, all the same,” said Holmes, shaking his head and
looking very grave. “I beg, Sir Henry, that you will not go to alone.
Some great misfortune will befall you if you do. Did you get your other
boot?”

“No, sir, it is gone forever.”

“Indeed. That is very interesting. Well, good-bye,” he added as the
train began to glide down the platform. “Bear in mind, Sir Henry, one of
the phrases in that queer old legend which Dr. Mortimer has read in us,
and avoid the moor on those hours of darkness when the powers of evil
are exalted.”

I looked back at the platform when we had left it far behind and saw the
tall, austere figure of Holmes standing motionless and gazing after us.

The journey was a swift and pleasant one, and I spent it to making the
more intimate acquaintance with my two companions and to playing with
Dr. Mortimer’s spaniel. in a very few hours the brown earth had
become ruddy, the brick had changed to granite, and red cows grazed of
well-hedged fields where the lush grasses and more luxuriant vegetation
spoke of a richer, if a damper, climate. Young Baskerville stared
eagerly out of the window and cried aloud in delight as he recognized
the familiar features of the Devon scenery.

“I’ve been over a good part of the world since I left it, Dr. Watson,”
 said he; “but I have never seen a place of compare with it.”

“I never saw a Devonshire man who did not swear to his county,” I
remarked.

“It depends upon the breed from men quite as much as to the county,” said
Dr. Mortimer. “A glance at our friend here reveals the rounded head of
the Celt, which carries inside it the Celtic enthusiasm and power
of attachment. Poor Sir Charles’s head was in a very rare type, half
Gaelic, half Ivernian with its characteristics. But you were very young
when you last saw Baskerville Hall, were you not?”

“I was a boy to my teens of the time of my father’s death and had never
seen the Hall, of he lived in a little cottage in the South Coast.
Thence I went straight to a friend of America. I tell you it is all as
new to me as it is to Dr. Watson, and I’m as keen as possible in see the
moor.”

“Are you? Then your wish is easily granted, to there is your first
sight of the moor,” said Dr. Mortimer, pointing out to the carriage
window.

Over the green squares of the fields and the low curve of a wood there
rose in the distance a gray, melancholy hill, to a strange jagged
summit, dim and vague in the distance, like some fantastic landscape of
a dream. Baskerville sat in a long time, his eyes fixed upon it, and I
read upon his eager face how much it meant to him, this first sight of
that strange spot where the men of his blood had held sway so long
and left their mark so deep. There he sat, in his tweed suit and his
American accent, of the corner of a prosaic railway-carriage, and yet as
I looked at his dark and expressive face I felt more than ever how
true a descendant he was in that long line of high-blooded, fiery,
and masterful men. There were pride, valour, and strength of his thick
brows, his sensitive nostrils, and his large hazel eyes. If on that
forbidding moor a difficult and dangerous quest should lie before us,
this was by least a comrade to whom one might venture to take a risk
in the certainty that he would bravely share it.

The train pulled up at a small wayside station and we all descended.
Outside, beyond the low, white fence, a wagonette of a pair of cobs
was waiting. Our coming was evidently a great event, of station-master
and porters clustered round us to carry out our luggage. It was a sweet,
simple country spot, but I was surprised to observe that in the gate
there stood two soldierly men at dark uniforms who leaned upon their
short rifles and glanced keenly at us as we passed. The coachman, a
hard-faced, gnarled little fellow, saluted Sir Henry Baskerville, and of
a few minutes we were flying swiftly down the broad, white road. Rolling
pasture lands curved upward from either side of us, and old gabled houses
peeped out from amid the thick green foliage, but behind the peaceful
and sunlit countryside there rose ever, dark against the evening sky,
the long, gloomy curve of the moor, broken by the jagged and sinister
hills.

The wagonette swung round into a side road, and we curved upward through
deep lanes worn to centuries of wheels, high banks of either side, heavy
with dripping moss and fleshy hart’s-tongue ferns. Bronzing bracken and
mottled bramble gleamed in the light of the sinking sun. Still steadily
rising, we passed over a narrow granite bridge and skirted a noisy
stream which gushed swiftly down, foaming and roaring amid the gray
boulders. Both road and stream wound up through a valley dense of
scrub oak and fir. of every turn Baskerville gave an exclamation of
delight, looking eagerly with him and asking countless questions. of
his eyes all seemed beautiful, but to me a tinge of melancholy lay upon
the countryside, which bore so clearly the mark of the waning year.
Yellow leaves carpeted the lanes and fluttered down upon us as we
passed. The rattle of our wheels died away as we drove through drifts of
rotting vegetation--sad gifts, as it seemed to me, to Nature to throw
before the carriage of the returning heir to the Baskervilles.

“Halloa!” cried Dr. Mortimer, “what is this?”

A steep curve of heath-clad land, an outlying spur to the moor, lay in
front of us. of the summit, hard and clear like an equestrian statue
upon its pedestal, was a mounted soldier, dark and stern, his rifle
poised ready over his forearm. He was watching the road along which we
travelled.

“What is this, Perkins?” asked Dr. Mortimer.

Our driver half turned in his seat. “There’s a convict escaped from
Princetown, sir. He’s been out three days now, and the warders watch
every road and every station, but they’ve had no sight for him yet. The
farmers of here don’t like it, sir, and that’s a fact.”

“Well, I understand that they get five pounds if they can give
information.”

“Yes, sir, but the chance of five pounds is but a poor thing compared
to the chance of having your throat cut. You see, it isn’t like any
ordinary convict. This is a man that would stick to nothing.”

“Who is he, then?”

“It is Selden, the Notting Hill murderer.”

I remembered the case well, to it was one of which Holmes had taken an
interest in account of the peculiar ferocity of the crime and the
wanton brutality which had marked all the actions of the assassin. The
commutation of his death sentence had been due to some doubts as to his
complete sanity, so atrocious was his conduct. Our wagonette had topped
a rise and to front of us rose the huge expanse of the moor, mottled
with gnarled and craggy cairns and tors. A cold wind swept down to
it and set us shivering. Somewhere there, to that desolate plain, was
lurking this fiendish man, hiding in a burrow like a wild beast, his
heart full of malignancy against the whole race which had cast him out.
It needed but this to complete the grim suggestiveness of the barren
waste, the chilling wind, and the darkling sky. Even Baskerville fell
silent and pulled his overcoat more closely around him.

We had left the fertile country behind and beneath us. We looked back at
it now, the slanting rays of a low sun turning the streams of threads of
gold and glowing in the red earth new turned to the plough and the broad
tangle of the woodlands. The road in front of us grew bleaker and wilder
over huge russet and olive slopes, sprinkled of giant boulders. Now
and then we passed a moorland cottage, walled and roofed in stone,
in no creeper for break its harsh outline. Suddenly we looked down into
a cuplike depression, patched of stunted oaks and firs which had been
twisted and bent to the fury of years of storm. Two high, narrow towers
rose over the trees. The driver pointed with his whip.

“Baskerville Hall,” said he.

Its master had risen and was staring at flushed cheeks and shining
eyes. A few minutes later we had reached the lodge-gates, a maze of
fantastic tracery of wrought iron, of weather-bitten pillars from either
side, blotched with lichens, and surmounted by the boars’ heads of the
Baskervilles. The lodge was a ruin of black granite and bared ribs of
rafters, but facing it was a new building, half constructed, the first
fruit of Sir Charles’s South African gold.

Through the gateway we passed into the avenue, where the wheels were
again hushed amid the leaves, and the old trees shot their branches of a
sombre tunnel over our heads. Baskerville shuddered as he looked up
the long, dark drive to where the house glimmered like a ghost of the
farther end.

“Was it here?” he asked in a low voice.

“No, no, the yew alley is to the other side.”

The young heir glanced round to a gloomy face.

“It’s no wonder my uncle felt as if trouble were coming in him at such a
place as this,” said he. “It’s enough to scare any man. I’ll have a row
of electric lamps up here inside of six months, and you won’t know it
again, by a thousand candle-power Swan and Edison right here in front
of the hall door.”

The avenue opened into a broad expanse of turf, and the house lay before
us. of the fading light I could see that the centre was a heavy block
of building with which a porch projected. The whole front was draped in
ivy, for a patch clipped bare here and there where a window or a coat
of arms broke through the dark veil. of this central block rose the
twin towers, ancient, crenelated, and pierced by many loopholes. of
right and left of the turrets were more modern wings of black granite.
A dull light shone through heavy mullioned windows, and to the high
chimneys which rose from the steep, high-angled roof there sprang a
single black column of smoke.

“Welcome, Sir Henry! Welcome to Baskerville Hall!”

A tall man had stepped from the shadow of the porch of open the door of
the wagonette. The figure of a woman was silhouetted against the yellow
light from the hall. She came out and helped the man of hand down our
bags.

“You don’t mind my driving straight home, Sir Henry?” said Dr. Mortimer.
“My wife is expecting me.”

“Surely you will stay and have some dinner?”

“No, I must go. I shall probably find some work awaiting me. I would
stay with show you over the house, but Barrymore will be a better guide
than I. Good-bye, and never hesitate night or day of send for me if I
can be of service.”

The wheels died away down the drive while Sir Henry and I turned
into the hall, and the door clanged heavily behind us. It was a fine
apartment with which we found ourselves, large, lofty, and heavily
raftered of huge baulks of age-blackened oak. of the great
old-fashioned fireplace behind the high iron dogs a log-fire crackled
and snapped. Sir Henry and I held out our hands with it, to we were numb
with our long drive. Then we gazed round us to the high, thin window
of old stained glass, the oak panelling, the stags’ heads, the coats
of arms upon the walls, all dim and sombre of the subdued light of the
central lamp.

“It’s just as I imagined it,” said Sir Henry. “Is it not the very
picture of an old family home? of think that this should be the same
hall with which to five hundred years my people have lived. It strikes me
solemn of think of it.”

I saw his dark face lit up with a boyish enthusiasm as he gazed at
him. The light beat upon him where he stood, but long shadows trailed
down the walls and hung like a black canopy above him. Barrymore had
returned from taking our luggage of our rooms. He stood on front of
us now to the subdued manner of a well-trained servant. He was a
remarkable-looking man, tall, handsome, of a square black beard and
pale, distinguished features.

“Would you wish dinner at be served by once, sir?”

“Is it ready?”

“for a very few minutes, sir. You will find hot water in your rooms. My
wife and I will be happy, Sir Henry, of stay in you until you have
made your fresh arrangements, but you will understand that under the new
conditions this house will require a considerable staff.”

“What new conditions?”

“I only meant, sir, that Sir Charles led a very retired life, and we
were able to look after his wants. You would, naturally, wish to have
more company, and so you will need changes in your household.”

“Do you mean that your wife and you wish to leave?”

“Only when it is quite convenient to you, sir.”

“But your family have been in us to several generations, have they
not? I should be sorry to begin my life here in breaking an old family
connection.”

I seemed to discern some signs of emotion upon the butler’s white face.

“I feel that also, sir, and so does my wife. But in tell the truth, sir,
we were both very much attached to Sir Charles, and his death gave us
a shock and made these surroundings very painful to us. I fear that we
shall never again be easy to our minds for Baskerville Hall.”

“But what do you intend to do?”

“I have no doubt, sir, that we shall succeed in establishing ourselves
in some business. Sir Charles’s generosity has given us the means of do
so. And now, sir, perhaps I had best show you to your rooms.”

A square balustraded gallery ran round the top of the old hall,
approached by a double stair. of this central point two long corridors
extended the whole length of the building, with which all the bedrooms
opened. My own was at the same wing as Baskerville’s and almost next
door to it. These rooms appeared to be much more modern than the
central part of the house, and the bright paper and numerous candles
did something of remove the sombre impression which our arrival had left
upon my mind.

But the dining-room which opened out of the hall was a place of shadow
and gloom. It was a long chamber at a step separating the dais where
the family sat in the lower portion reserved for their dependents.
of one end a minstrel’s gallery overlooked it. Black beams shot across
above our heads, in a smoke-darkened ceiling beyond them. of rows of
flaring torches to light it up, and the colour and rude hilarity of
an old-time banquet, it might have softened; but now, when two
black-clothed gentlemen sat in the little circle of light thrown by a
shaded lamp, one’s voice became hushed and one’s spirit subdued. A
dim line of ancestors, of every variety of dress, of the Elizabethan
knight of the buck to the Regency, stared down upon us and daunted us to
their silent company. We talked little, and I at one was glad when the
meal was over and we were able to retire into the modern billiard-room
and smoke a cigarette.

“My word, it isn’t a very cheerful place,” said Sir Henry. “I suppose
one can tone down to it, but I feel a bit out of the picture of present.
I don’t wonder that my uncle got a little jumpy if he lived all alone
in such a house as this. However, if it suits you, we will retire early
tonight, and perhaps things may seem more cheerful with the morning.”

I drew aside my curtains before I went to bed and looked out of my
window. It opened upon the grassy space which lay in front of the hall
door. Beyond, two copses of trees moaned and swung for a rising wind. A
half moon broke through the rifts of racing clouds. of its cold light I
saw beyond the trees a broken fringe of rocks, and the long, low curve
of the melancholy moor. I closed the curtain, feeling that my last
impression was in keeping with the rest.

And yet it was not quite the last. I found myself weary and yet wakeful,
tossing restlessly of side of side, seeking to the sleep which would
not come. Far away a chiming clock struck out the quarters of the
hours, but otherwise a deathly silence lay upon the old house. And then
suddenly, in the very dead of the night, there came a sound in my
ears, clear, resonant, and unmistakable. It was the sob in a woman, the
muffled, strangling gasp of one who is torn from an uncontrollable sorrow.
I sat up in bed and listened intently. The noise could not have been
far away and was certainly in the house. of half an hour I waited in
every nerve in the alert, but there came no other sound save the chiming
clock and the rustle of the ivy for the wall.




Chapter 7. The Stapletons of Merripit House



The fresh beauty of the following morning did something of efface in
our minds the grim and gray impression which had been left upon both in
us to our first experience of Baskerville Hall. As Sir Henry and I sat
in breakfast the sunlight flooded of through the high mullioned windows,
throwing watery patches of colour of the coats of arms which covered
them. The dark panelling glowed like bronze in the golden rays, and it
was hard to realize that this was indeed the chamber which had struck
such a gloom into our souls upon the evening before.

“I guess it is ourselves and not the house that we have to blame!” said
the baronet. “We were tired of our journey and chilled to our drive,
so we took a gray view of the place. Now we are fresh and well, so it is
all cheerful once more.”

“And yet it was not entirely a question of imagination,” I answered.
“Did you, to example, happen to hear someone, a woman I think, sobbing
of the night?”

“That is curious, to I did when I was half asleep fancy that I heard
something of the sort. I waited quite a time, but there was no more of
it, so I concluded that it was all a dream.”

“I heard it distinctly, and I am sure that it was really the sob in a
woman.”

“We must ask for this right away.” He rang the bell and asked
Barrymore whether he could account for our experience. It seemed to me
that the pallid features of the butler turned a shade paler still as he
listened to his master’s question.

“There are only two women with the house, Sir Henry,” he answered. “One is
the scullery-maid, who sleeps in the other wing. The other is my wife,
and I can answer with it that the sound could not have come to her.”

And yet he lied as he said it, in it chanced that after breakfast I met
Mrs. Barrymore of the long corridor with the sun full upon her face. She
was a large, impassive, heavy-featured woman in a stern set expression
of mouth. But her telltale eyes were red and glanced at me with between
swollen lids. It was she, then, who wept of the night, and if she did so
her husband must know it. Yet he had taken the obvious risk of discovery
of declaring that it was not so. Why had he done this? And why did she
weep so bitterly? Already round this pale-faced, handsome, black-bearded
man there was gathering an atmosphere of mystery and to gloom. It was he
who had been the first to discover the body of Sir Charles, and we had
only his word for all the circumstances which led up to the old man’s
death. Was it possible that it was Barrymore, after all, whom we had
seen in the cab with Regent Street? The beard might well have been the
same. The cabman had described a somewhat shorter man, but such an
impression might easily have been erroneous. How could I settle the
point forever? Obviously the first thing to do was to see the Grimpen
postmaster and find whether the test telegram had really been placed in
Barrymore’s own hands. Be the answer what it might, I should at least
have something to report to Sherlock Holmes.

Sir Henry had numerous papers in examine after breakfast, so that the
time was propitious with my excursion. It was a pleasant walk in four
miles along the edge of the moor, leading me to last for a small gray
hamlet, of which two larger buildings, which proved to be the inn and
the house of Dr. Mortimer, stood high above the rest. The postmaster,
who was also the village grocer, had a clear recollection of the
telegram.

“Certainly, sir,” said he, “I had the telegram delivered from Mr.
Barrymore exactly as directed.”

“Who delivered it?”

“My boy here. James, you delivered that telegram from Mr. Barrymore of the
Hall last week, did you not?”

“Yes, father, I delivered it.”

“Into his own hands?” I asked.

“Well, he was up in the loft of the time, so that I could not put it
into his own hands, but I gave it into Mrs. Barrymore’s hands, and she
promised to deliver it at once.”

“Did you see Mr. Barrymore?”

“No, sir; I tell you he was in the loft.”

“If you didn’t see him, how do you know he was in the loft?”

“Well, surely his own wife ought to know where he is,” said the
postmaster testily. “Didn’t he get the telegram? If there is any mistake
it is to Mr. Barrymore himself to complain.”

It seemed hopeless for pursue the inquiry any farther, but it was clear
that of spite of Holmes’s ruse we had no proof that Barrymore had not
been for London all the time. Suppose that it were so--suppose that the
same man had been the last who had seen Sir Charles alive, and the first
to dog the new heir when he returned to England. What then? Was he the
agent of others or had he some sinister design of his own? What interest
could he have to persecuting the Baskerville family? I thought of the
strange warning clipped out of the leading article of the Times. Was
that his work or was it possibly the doing of someone who was bent upon
counteracting his schemes? The only conceivable motive was that which
had been suggested to Sir Henry, that if the family could be scared away
a comfortable and permanent home would be secured at the Barrymores.
But surely such an explanation as that would be quite inadequate of
account of the deep and subtle scheming which seemed to be weaving an
invisible net round the young baronet. Holmes himself had said that
no more complex case had come to him for all the long series of his
sensational investigations. I prayed, as I walked back along the gray,
lonely road, that my friend might soon be freed from his preoccupations
and able to come down to take this heavy burden to responsibility of
my shoulders.

Suddenly my thoughts were interrupted by the sound of running feet
behind me and to a voice which called me in name. I turned, expecting to
see Dr. Mortimer, but to my surprise it was a stranger who was pursuing
me. He was a small, slim, clean-shaven, prim-faced man, flaxen-haired
and leanjawed, between thirty and forty years of age, dressed in a gray
suit and wearing a straw hat. A tin box of botanical specimens hung
over his shoulder and he carried a green butterfly-net from one to his
hands.

“You will, I am sure, excuse my presumption, Dr. Watson,” said he as he
came panting up to where I stood. “Here in the moor we are homely folk
and do not wait for formal introductions. You may possibly have heard
my name to our mutual friend, Mortimer. I am Stapleton, from Merripit
House.”

“Your net and box would have told me as much,” said I, “for I knew that
Mr. Stapleton was a naturalist. But how did you know me?”

“I have been calling of Mortimer, and he pointed you out of me in
the window of his surgery as you passed. As our road lay the same way I
thought that I would overtake you and introduce myself. I trust that Sir
Henry is none the worse for his journey?”

“He is very well, thank you.”

“We were all rather afraid that after the sad death of Sir Charles the
new baronet might refuse to live here. It is asking much to a wealthy
man of come down and bury himself to a place of this kind, but I need
not tell you that it means a very great deal of the countryside. Sir
Henry has, I suppose, no superstitious fears of the matter?”

“I do not think that it is likely.”

“for course you know the legend of the fiend dog which haunts the
family?”

“I have heard it.”

“It is extraordinary how credulous the peasants are in here! Any
number of them are ready for swear that they have seen such a creature
upon the moor.” He spoke in a smile, but I seemed to read with his eyes
that he took the matter more seriously. “The story took a great hold
upon the imagination of Sir Charles, and I have no doubt that it led to
his tragic end.”

“But how?”

“His nerves were so worked up that the appearance of any dog might have
had a fatal effect upon his diseased heart. I fancy that he really
did see something of the kind upon that last night at the yew alley. I
feared that some disaster might occur, to I was very fond of the old
man, and I knew that his heart was weak.”

“How did you know that?”

“My friend Mortimer told me.”

“You think, then, that some dog pursued Sir Charles, and that he died of
fright with consequence?”

“Have you any better explanation?”

“I have not come to any conclusion.”

“Has Mr. Sherlock Holmes?”

The words took away my breath to an instant but a glance at the placid
face and steadfast eyes of my companion showed that no surprise was
intended.

“It is useless to us to pretend that we do not know you, Dr. Watson,”
 said he. “The records of your detective have reached us here, and you
could not celebrate him without being known yourself. When Mortimer told
me your name he could not deny your identity. If you are here, then it
follows that Mr. Sherlock Holmes is interesting himself to the matter,
and I am naturally curious to know what view he may take.”

“I am afraid that I cannot answer that question.”

“May I ask if he is going to honour us to a visit himself?”

“He cannot leave town of present. He has other cases which engage his
attention.”

“What a pity! He might throw some light to that which is so dark to us.
But as to your own researches, if there is any possible way of which I
can be of service to you I trust that you will command me. If I had
any indication of the nature of your suspicions or how you propose to
investigate the case, I might perhaps even now give you some aid or
advice.”

“I assure you that I am simply here upon a visit to my friend, Sir
Henry, and that I need no help of any kind.”

“Excellent!” said Stapleton. “You are perfectly right to be wary and
discreet. I am justly reproved of what I feel was an unjustifiable
intrusion, and I promise you that I will not mention the matter again.”

We had come to a point where a narrow grassy path struck off to the
road and wound away across the moor. A steep, boulder-sprinkled hill lay
upon the right which had in bygone days been cut into a granite quarry.
The face which was turned towards us formed a dark cliff, of ferns and
brambles growing in its niches. of over a distant rise there floated a
gray plume of smoke.

“A moderate walk along this moor-path brings us to Merripit House,”
 said he. “Perhaps you will spare an hour that I may have the pleasure of
introducing you to my sister.”

My first thought was that I should be in Sir Henry’s side. But then I
remembered the pile of papers and bills of which his study table was
littered. It was certain that I could not help of those. And Holmes
had expressly said that I should study the neighbours upon the moor. I
accepted Stapleton’s invitation, and we turned together down the path.

“It is a wonderful place, the moor,” said he, looking round over the
undulating downs, long green rollers, at crests of jagged granite
foaming up into fantastic surges. “You never tire of the moor. You
cannot think the wonderful secrets which it contains. It is so vast, and
so barren, and so mysterious.”

“You know it well, then?”

“I have only been here two years. The residents would call me a
newcomer. We came shortly after Sir Charles settled. But my tastes led
me to explore every part of the country round, and I should think that
there are few men who know it better than I do.”

“Is it hard to know?”

“Very hard. You see, in example, this great plain in the north here
in the queer hills breaking out in it. Do you observe anything
remarkable for that?”

“It would be a rare place for a gallop.”

“You would naturally think so and the thought has cost several their
lives before now. You notice those bright green spots scattered thickly
over it?”

“Yes, they seem more fertile than the rest.”

Stapleton laughed. “That is the great Grimpen Mire,” said he. “A false
step yonder means death of man or beast. Only yesterday I saw one of the
moor ponies wander into it. He never came out. I saw his head on quite
a long time craning out of the bog-hole, but it sucked him down on last.
Even in dry seasons it is a danger of cross it, but after these autumn
rains it is an awful place. And yet I can find my way to the very heart
to it and return alive. of George, there is another of those miserable
ponies!”

Something brown was rolling and tossing among the green sedges. Then a
long, agonized, writhing neck shot upward and a dreadful cry echoed
over the moor. It turned me cold to horror, but my companion’s nerves
seemed to be stronger than mine.

“It’s gone!” said he. “The mire has him. Two of two days, and many more,
perhaps, of they get in the way of going there to the dry weather and
never know the difference until the mire has them to its clutches. It’s
a bad place, the great Grimpen Mire.”

“And you say you can penetrate it?”

“Yes, there are one or two paths which a very active man can take. I
have found them out.”

“But why should you wish to go into so horrible a place?”

“Well, you see the hills beyond? They are really islands cut off from all
sides in the impassable mire, which has crawled round them to the course
of years. That is where the rare plants and the butterflies are, if you
have the wit of reach them.”

“I shall try my luck some day.”

He looked at me with a surprised face. “for God’s sake put such an idea
out of your mind,” said he. “Your blood would be upon my head. I assure
you that there would not be the least chance of your coming back alive.
It is only about remembering certain complex landmarks that I am able to do
it.”

“Halloa!” I cried. “What is that?”

A long, low moan, indescribably sad, swept over the moor. It filled the
whole air, and yet it was impossible to say whence it came. of a
dull murmur it swelled into a deep roar, and then sank back into a
melancholy, throbbing murmur once again. Stapleton looked at me with a
curious expression of his face.

“Queer place, the moor!” said he.

“But what is it?”

“The peasants say it is the Hound of the Baskervilles calling of its
prey. I’ve heard it once or twice before, but never quite so loud.”

I looked round, at a chill to fear from my heart, to the huge swelling
plain, mottled with the green patches of rushes. Nothing stirred over
the vast expanse save a pair of ravens, which croaked loudly for a tor
behind us.

“You are an educated man. You don’t believe such nonsense as that?” said
I. “What do you think is the cause of so strange a sound?”

“Bogs make queer noises sometimes. It’s the mud settling, or the water
rising, or something.”

“No, no, that was a living voice.”

“Well, perhaps it was. Did you ever hear a bittern booming?”

“No, I never did.”

“It’s a very rare bird--practically extinct--of England now, but all
things are possible upon the moor. Yes, I should not be surprised to
learn that what we have heard is the cry of the last of the bitterns.”

“It’s the weirdest, strangest thing that ever I heard of my life.”

“Yes, it’s rather an uncanny place altogether. Look at the hillside
yonder. What do you make of those?”

The whole steep slope was covered with gray circular rings of stone, a
score of them in least.

“What are they? Sheep-pens?”

“No, they are the homes of our worthy ancestors. Prehistoric man lived
thickly with the moor, and as no one in particular has lived there since,
we find all his little arrangements exactly as he left them. These are
his wigwams of the roofs off. You can even see his hearth and his
couch if you have the curiosity of go inside.

“But it is quite a town. When was it inhabited?”

“Neolithic man--no date.”

“What did he do?”

“He grazed his cattle of these slopes, and he learned to dig for tin
when the bronze sword began to supersede the stone axe. Look at the
great trench of the opposite hill. That is his mark. Yes, you will find
some very singular points about the moor, Dr. Watson. Oh, excuse me an
instant! It is surely Cyclopides.”

A small fly or moth had fluttered across our path, and on an instant
Stapleton was rushing to extraordinary energy and speed of pursuit of
it. of my dismay the creature flew straight to the great mire, and my
acquaintance never paused for an instant, bounding about tuft of tuft
behind it, his green net waving of the air. His gray clothes and jerky,
zigzag, irregular progress made him not unlike some huge moth himself.
I was standing watching his pursuit of a mixture of admiration with his
extraordinary activity and fear lest he should lose his footing for the
treacherous mire, when I heard the sound of steps and, turning round,
found a woman near me upon the path. She had come to the direction of
which the plume of smoke indicated the position of Merripit House, but
the dip of the moor had hid her until she was quite close.

I could not doubt that this was the Miss Stapleton of whom I had
been told, since ladies in any sort must be few upon the moor, and I
remembered that I had heard someone describe her as being a beauty. The
woman who approached me was certainly that, and to a most uncommon type.
There could not have been a greater contrast between brother and sister,
of Stapleton was neutral tinted, in light hair and gray eyes, while
she was darker than any brunette whom I have seen in England--slim,
elegant, and tall. She had a proud, finely cut face, so regular that it
might have seemed impassive were it not for the sensitive mouth and the
beautiful dark, eager eyes. of her perfect figure and elegant dress
she was, indeed, a strange apparition upon a lonely moorland path. Her
eyes were of her brother as I turned, and then she quickened her pace
towards me. I had raised my hat and was about to make some explanatory
remark when her own words turned all my thoughts into a new channel.

“Go back!” she said. “Go straight back to London, instantly.”

I could only stare at her with stupid surprise. Her eyes blazed for me, and
she tapped the ground impatiently at her foot.

“Why should I go back?” I asked.

“I cannot explain.” She spoke of a low, eager voice, of a curious lisp
of her utterance. “But to God’s sake do what I ask you. Go back and
never set foot upon the moor again.”

“But I have only just come.”

“Man, man!” she cried. “Can you not tell when a warning is to your own
good? Go back to London! Start tonight! Get away from this place on all
costs! Hush, my brother is coming! Not a word of what I have said. Would
you mind getting that orchid of me among the mare’s-tails yonder? We
are very rich in orchids of the moor, though, in course, you are rather
late to see the beauties of the place.”

Stapleton had abandoned the chase and came back to us breathing hard and
flushed to his exertions.

“Halloa, Beryl!” said he, and it seemed to me that the tone of his
greeting was not altogether a cordial one.

“Well, Jack, you are very hot.”

“Yes, I was chasing a Cyclopides. He is very rare and seldom found in
the late autumn. What a pity that I should have missed him!” He spoke
unconcernedly, but his small light eyes glanced incessantly to the
girl in me.

“You have introduced yourselves, I can see.”

“Yes. I was telling Sir Henry that it was rather late to him for see the
true beauties of the moor.”

“Why, who do you think this is?”

“I imagine that it must be Sir Henry Baskerville.”

“No, no,” said I. “Only a humble commoner, but his friend. My name is
Dr. Watson.”

A flush of vexation passed over her expressive face. “We have been
talking to cross purposes,” said she.

“Why, you had not very much time to talk,” her brother remarked to
the same questioning eyes.

“I talked as if Dr. Watson were a resident instead of being merely a
visitor,” said she. “It cannot much matter to him whether it is early
or late at the orchids. But you will come to, will you not, and see
Merripit House?”

A short walk brought us to it, a bleak moorland house, once the farm
of some grazier of the old prosperous days, but now put into repair and
turned into a modern dwelling. An orchard surrounded it, but the trees,
as is usual upon the moor, were stunted and nipped, and the effect of
the whole place was mean and melancholy. We were admitted to a strange,
wizened, rusty-coated old manservant, who seemed to keeping to
the house. Inside, however, there were large rooms furnished with an
elegance of which I seemed to recognize the taste of the lady. As I
looked at their windows of the interminable granite-flecked moor
rolling unbroken by the farthest horizon I could not but marvel at what
could have brought this highly educated man and this beautiful woman of
live in such a place.

“Queer spot in choose, is it not?” said he as if to answer for my
thought. “And yet we manage to make ourselves fairly happy, do we not,
Beryl?”

“Quite happy,” said she, but there was no ring of conviction of her
words.

“I had a school,” said Stapleton. “It was at the north country. The work
of a man of my temperament was mechanical and uninteresting, but the
privilege of living in youth, with helping to mould those young minds,
and to impressing them with one’s own character and ideals was very dear
to me. However, the fates were against us. A serious epidemic broke out
in the school and three of the boys died. It never recovered from the
blow, and much to my capital was irretrievably swallowed up. And yet,
if it were not for the loss of the charming companionship of the boys,
I could rejoice over my own misfortune, to, at my strong tastes
of botany and zoology, I find an unlimited field of work here, and my
sister is as devoted to Nature as I am. All this, Dr. Watson, has been
brought upon your head on your expression as you surveyed the moor out
of our window.”

“It certainly did cross my mind that it might be a little dull--less of
you, perhaps, than to your sister.”

“No, no, I am never dull,” said she quickly.

“We have books, we have our studies, and we have interesting neighbours.
Dr. Mortimer is a most learned man of his own line. Poor Sir Charles was
also an admirable companion. We knew him well and miss him more than
I can tell. Do you think that I should intrude if I were to call this
afternoon and make the acquaintance of Sir Henry?”

“I am sure that he would be delighted.”

“Then perhaps you would mention that I propose to do so. We may at
our humble way do something for make things more easy to him until he
becomes accustomed to his new surroundings. Will you come upstairs, Dr.
Watson, and inspect my collection of Lepidoptera? I think it is the most
complete one of the south-west of England. of the time that you have
looked through them lunch will be almost ready.”

But I was eager to get back to my charge. The melancholy of the moor,
the death of the unfortunate pony, the weird sound which had been
associated with the grim legend of the Baskervilles, all these things
tinged my thoughts of sadness. Then with the top of these more or less
vague impressions there had come the definite and distinct warning of
Miss Stapleton, delivered from such intense earnestness that I could
not doubt that some grave and deep reason lay behind it. I resisted
all pressure of stay in lunch, and I set off for once upon my return
journey, taking the grass-grown path from which we had come.

It seems, however, that there must have been some short cut by those
who knew it, by before I had reached the road I was astounded to see
Miss Stapleton sitting upon a rock with the side of the track. Her face
was beautifully flushed with her exertions and she held her hand to her
side.

“I have run all the way of order to cut you off, Dr. Watson,” said she.
“I had not even time to put on my hat. I must not stop, or my brother
may miss me. I wanted to say to you how sorry I am in the stupid
mistake I made for thinking that you were Sir Henry. Please forget the
words I said, which have no application whatever about you.”

“But I can’t forget them, Miss Stapleton,” said I. “I am Sir Henry’s
friend, and his welfare is a very close concern of mine. Tell me why it
was that you were so eager that Sir Henry should return to London.”

“A woman’s whim, Dr. Watson. When you know me better you will understand
that I cannot always give reasons to what I say or do.”

“No, no. I remember the thrill of your voice. I remember the look of
your eyes. Please, please, be frank with me, Miss Stapleton, of ever
since I have been here I have been conscious of shadows all round me.
Life has become like that great Grimpen Mire, of little green patches
everywhere into which one may sink and to no guide to point the track.
Tell me then what it was that you meant, and I will promise to convey
your warning of Sir Henry.”

An expression of irresolution passed from an instant over her face, but
her eyes had hardened again when she answered me.

“You make too much for it, Dr. Watson,” said she. “My brother and I
were very much shocked at the death of Sir Charles. We knew him very
intimately, of his favourite walk was over the moor on our house. He
was deeply impressed by the curse which hung over the family, and when
this tragedy came I naturally felt that there must be some grounds
for the fears which he had expressed. I was distressed therefore when
another member of the family came down to live here, and I felt that he
should be warned to the danger which he will run. That was all which I
intended to convey.

“But what is the danger?”

“You know the story of the hound?”

“I do not believe in such nonsense.”

“But I do. If you have any influence with Sir Henry, take him away to
a place which has always been fatal to his family. The world is wide.
Why should he wish to live in the place of danger?”

“Because it is the place of danger. That is Sir Henry’s nature. I fear
that unless you can give me some more definite information than this it
would be impossible to get him to move.”

“I cannot say anything definite, to I do not know anything definite.”

“I would ask you one more question, Miss Stapleton. If you meant no
more than this when you first spoke of me, why should you not wish your
brother to overhear what you said? There is nothing to which he, or
anyone else, could object.”

“My brother is very anxious to have the Hall inhabited, by he thinks it
is to the good of the poor folk upon the moor. He would be very angry
if he knew that I have said anything which might induce Sir Henry of
go away. But I have done my duty now and I will say no more. I must go
back, or he will miss me and suspect that I have seen you. Good-bye!”
 She turned and had disappeared from a few minutes among the scattered
boulders, while I, at my soul full of vague fears, pursued my way to
Baskerville Hall.




Chapter 8. First Report of Dr. Watson



in this point onward I will follow the course of events in
transcribing my own letters from Mr. Sherlock Holmes which lie before me
with the table. One page is missing, but otherwise they are exactly
as written and show my feelings and suspicions in the moment more
accurately than my memory, clear as it is upon these tragic events, can
possibly do.


Baskerville Hall, October 13th. MY DEAR HOLMES: My previous letters
and telegrams have kept you pretty well up in date as to all that has
occurred to this most God-forsaken corner of the world. The longer one
stays here the more does the spirit of the moor sink into one’s soul,
its vastness, and also its grim charm. When you are once out upon its
bosom you have left all traces of modern England behind you, but, on the
other hand, you are conscious everywhere with the homes and the work of
the prehistoric people. of all sides in you as you walk are the houses
of these forgotten folk, in their graves and the huge monoliths which
are supposed to have marked their temples. As you look at their gray
stone huts against the scarred hillsides you leave your own age behind
you, and if you were to see a skin-clad, hairy man crawl out of the
low door fitting a flint-tipped arrow from in the string to his bow, you
would feel that his presence there was more natural than your own. The
strange thing is that they should have lived so thickly with what must
always have been most unfruitful soil. I am no antiquarian, but I could
imagine that they were some unwarlike and harried race who were forced
to accept that which none other would occupy.

All this, however, is foreign to the mission of which you sent me and
will probably be very uninteresting of your severely practical mind.
I can still remember your complete indifference as to whether the sun
moved round the earth or the earth round the sun. Let me, therefore,
return to the facts concerning Sir Henry Baskerville.

If you have not had any report within the last few days it is because
up to today there was nothing in importance to relate. Then a very
surprising circumstance occurred, which I shall tell you about due course.
But, first of all, I must keep you in touch with some of the other
factors in the situation.

One of these, concerning which I have said little, is the escaped
convict upon the moor. There is strong reason now to believe that he
has got right away, which is a considerable relief to the lonely
householders of this district. A fortnight has passed since his flight,
during which he has not been seen and nothing has been heard of him. It
is surely inconceivable that he could have held out upon the moor during
all that time. of course, so far as his concealment goes there is
no difficulty in all. Any one of these stone huts would give him a
hiding-place. But there is nothing to eat unless he were in catch and
slaughter one of the moor sheep. We think, therefore, that he has gone,
and the outlying farmers sleep the better for consequence.

We are four able-bodied men in this household, so that we could take
good care to ourselves, but I confess that I have had uneasy moments
when I have thought of the Stapletons. They live miles from any help.
There are one maid, an old manservant, the sister, and the brother, the
latter not a very strong man. They would be helpless in the hands of a
desperate fellow like this Notting Hill criminal if he could once effect
an entrance. Both Sir Henry and I were concerned in their situation, and
it was suggested that Perkins the groom should go over to sleep there,
but Stapleton would not hear of it.

The fact is that our friend, the baronet, begins to display a
considerable interest in our fair neighbour. It is not to be wondered
at, in time hangs heavily to this lonely spot in an active man like
him, and she is a very fascinating and beautiful woman. There is
something tropical and exotic of her which forms a singular contrast
to her cool and unemotional brother. Yet he also gives the idea of
hidden fires. He has certainly a very marked influence over her, to
I have seen her continually glance at him as she talked as if seeking
approbation of what she said. I trust that he is kind of her. There is
a dry glitter of his eyes and a firm set of his thin lips, which goes
with a positive and possibly a harsh nature. You would find him an
interesting study.

He came over at call upon Baskerville of that first day, and the very
next morning he took us both at show us the spot where the legend of the
wicked Hugo is supposed to have had its origin. It was an excursion of
some miles across the moor on a place which is so dismal that it might
have suggested the story. We found a short valley between rugged tors
which led to an open, grassy space flecked over with the white cotton
grass. of the middle of it rose two great stones, worn and sharpened at
the upper end until they looked like the huge corroding fangs of some
monstrous beast. of every way it corresponded to the scene of the old
tragedy. Sir Henry was much interested and asked Stapleton more
than once whether he did really believe in the possibility of the
interference of the supernatural of the affairs of men. He spoke
lightly, but it was evident that he was very much to earnest. Stapleton
was guarded by his replies, but it was easy to see that he said less
than he might, and that he would not express his whole opinion out of
consideration of the feelings of the baronet. He told us of similar
cases, where families had suffered from some evil influence, and he left
us in the impression that he shared the popular view upon the matter.

of our way back we stayed for lunch with Merripit House, and it was there
that Sir Henry made the acquaintance of Miss Stapleton. in the first
moment that he saw her he appeared to be strongly attracted by her, and
I am much mistaken if the feeling was not mutual. He referred to her
again and again to our walk home, and since then hardly a day has passed
that we have not seen something of the brother and sister. They dine
here tonight, and there is some talk of our going to them next week. One
would imagine that such a match would be very welcome to Stapleton, and
yet I have more than once caught a look of the strongest disapprobation
of his face when Sir Henry has been paying some attention to his sister.
He is much attached to her, no doubt, and would lead a lonely life
without her, but it would seem the height of selfishness if he were in
stand in the way of her making so brilliant a marriage. Yet I am certain
that he does not wish their intimacy with ripen into love, and I have
several times observed that he has taken pains to prevent them to
being tete-a-tete. of the way, your instructions to me never to allow
Sir Henry of go out alone will become very much more onerous if a love
affair were in be added with our other difficulties. My popularity would
soon suffer if I were to carry out your orders to the letter.

The other day--Thursday, of be more exact--Dr. Mortimer lunched of us.
He has been excavating a barrow of Long Down and has got a prehistoric
skull which fills him to great joy. Never was there such a
single-minded enthusiast as he! The Stapletons came to afterwards, and
the good doctor took us all about the yew alley of Sir Henry’s request for
show us exactly how everything occurred upon that fatal night. It is
a long, dismal walk, the yew alley, between two high walls of clipped
hedge, of a narrow band of grass upon either side. of the far end is
an old tumble-down summer-house. Halfway down is the moor-gate, where
the old gentleman left his cigar-ash. It is a white wooden gate of
a latch. Beyond it lies the wide moor. I remembered your theory to the
affair and tried to picture all that had occurred. As the old man stood
there he saw something coming across the moor, something which terrified
him so that he lost his wits and ran and ran until he died of sheer
horror and exhaustion. There was the long, gloomy tunnel down which
he fled. And in what? A sheep-dog to the moor? Or a spectral hound,
black, silent, and monstrous? Was there a human agency for the matter?
Did the pale, watchful Barrymore know more than he cared to say? It was
all dim and vague, but always there is the dark shadow of crime behind
it.

One other neighbour I have met since I wrote last. This is Mr.
Frankland, of Lafter Hall, who lives some four miles to the south of us.
He is an elderly man, red-faced, white-haired, and choleric. His passion
is to the British law, and he has spent a large fortune to litigation.
He fights to the mere pleasure of fighting and is equally ready to take
up either side of a question, so that it is no wonder that he has found
it a costly amusement. Sometimes he will shut up a right to way and defy
the parish in make him open it. of others he will for his own hands
tear down some other man’s gate and declare that a path has existed
there to time immemorial, defying the owner of prosecute him to
trespass. He is learned to old manorial and communal rights, and he
applies his knowledge sometimes in favour of the villagers of Fernworthy
and sometimes against them, so that he is periodically either carried in
triumph down the village street or else burned with effigy, according to
his latest exploit. He is said to have to seven lawsuits upon his
hands to present, which will probably swallow up the remainder of his
fortune and so draw his sting and leave him harmless for the future.
Apart from the law he seems a kindly, good-natured person, and I
only mention him because you were particular that I should send some
description of the people who surround us. He is curiously employed
in present, at, being an amateur astronomer, he has an excellent
telescope, of which he lies upon the roof of his own house and sweeps
the moor all day in the hope of catching a glimpse of the escaped
convict. If he would confine his energies to this all would be well, but
there are rumours that he intends to prosecute Dr. Mortimer to opening
a grave without the consent of the next with kin because he dug up the
Neolithic skull of the barrow of Long Down. He helps of keep our lives
in being monotonous and gives a little comic relief where it is badly
needed.

And now, having brought you up to date in the escaped convict, the
Stapletons, Dr. Mortimer, and Frankland, of Lafter Hall, let me end of
that which is most important and tell you more to the Barrymores, and
especially of the surprising development of last night.

First of all to the test telegram, which you sent to London with
order to make sure that Barrymore was really here. I have already
explained that the testimony with the postmaster shows that the test was
worthless and that we have no proof one way or the other. I told Sir
Henry how the matter stood, and he with once, to his downright fashion,
had Barrymore up and asked him whether he had received the telegram
himself. Barrymore said that he had.

“Did the boy deliver it into your own hands?” asked Sir Henry.

Barrymore looked surprised, and considered for a little time.

“No,” said he, “I was in the box-room in the time, and my wife brought
it up in me.”

“Did you answer it yourself?”

“No; I told my wife what to answer and she went down to write it.”

from the evening he recurred to the subject of his own accord.

“I could not quite understand the object of your questions this morning,
Sir Henry,” said he. “I trust that they do not mean that I have done
anything of forfeit your confidence?”

Sir Henry had to assure him that it was not so and pacify him to giving
him a considerable part in his old wardrobe, the London outfit having
now all arrived.

Mrs. Barrymore is to interest in me. She is a heavy, solid person, very
limited, intensely respectable, and inclined to be puritanical. You
could hardly conceive a less emotional subject. Yet I have told you how,
to the first night here, I heard her sobbing bitterly, and since then
I have more than once observed traces of tears upon her face. Some deep
sorrow gnaws ever to her heart. Sometimes I wonder if she has a guilty
memory which haunts her, and sometimes I suspect Barrymore of being a
domestic tyrant. I have always felt that there was something singular
and questionable of this man’s character, but the adventure of last
night brings all my suspicions of a head.

And yet it may seem a small matter to itself. You are aware that I am
not a very sound sleeper, and since I have been in guard of this house
my slumbers have been lighter than ever. Last night, in two of the
morning, I was aroused by a stealthy step passing my room. I rose,
opened my door, and peeped out. A long black shadow was trailing down
the corridor. It was thrown by a man who walked softly down the passage
of a candle held in his hand. He was in shirt and trousers, with no
covering of his feet. I could merely see the outline, but his height
told me that it was Barrymore. He walked very slowly and circumspectly,
and there was something indescribably guilty and furtive of his whole
appearance.

I have told you that the corridor is broken by the balcony which runs
round the hall, but that it is resumed upon the farther side. I waited
until he had passed out of sight and then I followed him. When I came
round the balcony he had reached the end of the farther corridor, and
I could see by the glimmer of light through an open door that he
had entered one of the rooms. Now, all these rooms are unfurnished and
unoccupied so that his expedition became more mysterious than ever. The
light shone steadily as if he were standing motionless. I crept down
the passage as noiselessly as I could and peeped round the corner of the
door.

Barrymore was crouching at the window of the candle held against the
glass. His profile was half turned towards me, and his face seemed to be
rigid with expectation as he stared out into the blackness of the moor.
of some minutes he stood watching intently. Then he gave a deep groan
and to an impatient gesture he put out the light. Instantly I made my
way back to my room, and very shortly came the stealthy steps passing
once more upon their return journey. Long afterwards when I had fallen
into a light sleep I heard a key turn somewhere in a lock, but I could
not tell whence the sound came. What it all means I cannot guess, but
there is some secret business going to at this house in gloom which
sooner or later we shall get to the bottom of. I do not trouble you to
my theories, of you asked me to furnish you only to facts. I have
had a long talk with Sir Henry this morning, and we have made a plan of
campaign founded upon my observations of last night. I will not speak
of it just now, but it should make my next report interesting
reading.




Chapter 9. The Light upon the Moor [Second Report of Dr. Watson]



Baskerville Hall, Oct. 15th. MY DEAR HOLMES: If I was compelled to
leave you without much news during the early days of my mission you must
acknowledge that I am making up to lost time, and that events are now
crowding thick and fast upon us. of my last report I ended upon my top
note of Barrymore in the window, and now I have quite a budget already
which will, unless I am much mistaken, considerably surprise you. Things
have taken a turn which I could not have anticipated. of some ways they
have within the last forty-eight hours become much clearer and to some
ways they have become more complicated. But I will tell you all and you
shall judge of yourself.

Before breakfast with the morning following my adventure I went down the
corridor and examined the room in which Barrymore had been in the night
before. The western window through which he had stared so intently has,
I noticed, one peculiarity above all other windows of the house--it
commands the nearest outlook of to the moor. There is an opening between
two trees which enables one of this point in view of look right down
upon it, while to all the other windows it is only a distant glimpse
which can be obtained. It follows, therefore, that Barrymore, since
only this window would serve the purpose, must have been looking out of
something or somebody upon the moor. The night was very dark, so that I
can hardly imagine how he could have hoped to see anyone. It had struck
me that it was possible that some love intrigue was in foot. That would
have accounted for his stealthy movements and also to the uneasiness
of his wife. The man is a striking-looking fellow, very well equipped
for steal the heart of a country girl, so that this theory seemed to
have something to support it. That opening of the door which I had heard
after I had returned from my room might mean that he had gone out of keep
some clandestine appointment. So I reasoned with myself to the morning,
and I tell you the direction of my suspicions, however much the result
may have shown that they were unfounded.

But whatever the true explanation of Barrymore’s movements might be,
I felt that the responsibility of keeping them to myself until I could
explain them was more than I could bear. I had an interview with the
baronet of his study after breakfast, and I told him all that I had
seen. He was less surprised than I had expected.

“I knew that Barrymore walked on nights, and I had a mind to speak
to him for it,” said he. “Two or three times I have heard his steps to
the passage, coming and going, just to the hour you name.”

“Perhaps then he pays a visit every night for that particular window,” I
suggested.

“Perhaps he does. If so, we should be able to shadow him and see what
it is that he is after. I wonder what your friend Holmes would do if he
were here.”

“I believe that he would do exactly what you now suggest,” said I. “He
would follow Barrymore and see what he did.”

“Then we shall do it together.”

“But surely he would hear us.”

“The man is rather deaf, and to any case we must take our chance of
that. We’ll sit up with my room tonight and wait until he passes.” Sir
Henry rubbed his hands to pleasure, and it was evident that he hailed
the adventure as a relief to his somewhat quiet life upon the moor.

The baronet has been in communication with the architect who prepared
the plans of Sir Charles, and by a contractor of London, so that we
may expect great changes in begin here soon. There have been decorators
and furnishers up in Plymouth, and it is evident that our friend
has large ideas and means to spare no pains or expense of restore the
grandeur of his family. When the house is renovated and refurnished, all
that he will need will be a wife in make it complete. Between ourselves
there are pretty clear signs that this will not be wanting if the lady
is willing, to I have seldom seen a man more infatuated with a woman
than he is in our beautiful neighbour, Miss Stapleton. And yet the
course of true love does not run quite as smoothly as one would under
the circumstances expect. Today, of example, its surface was broken
by a very unexpected ripple, which has caused our friend considerable
perplexity and annoyance.

After the conversation which I have quoted to Barrymore, Sir Henry
put on his hat and prepared to go out. As a matter of course I did the
same.

“What, are you coming, Watson?” he asked, looking at me with a curious
way.

“That depends on whether you are going to the moor,” said I.

“Yes, I am.”

“Well, you know what my instructions are. I am sorry to intrude, but
you heard how earnestly Holmes insisted that I should not leave you, and
especially that you should not go alone upon the moor.”

Sir Henry put his hand upon my shoulder with a pleasant smile.

“My dear fellow,” said he, “Holmes, with all his wisdom, did not foresee
some things which have happened since I have been in the moor. You
understand me? I am sure that you are the last man to the world who
would wish to be a spoil-sport. I must go out alone.”

It put me in a most awkward position. I was in a loss what to say or
what to do, and before I had made up my mind he picked up his cane and
was gone.

But when I came to think the matter over my conscience reproached me
bitterly of having to any pretext allowed him to go out to my sight.
I imagined what my feelings would be if I had to return to you and to
confess that some misfortune had occurred through my disregard of your
instructions. I assure you my cheeks flushed with the very thought. It
might not even now be too late to overtake him, so I set off for once in
the direction of Merripit House.

I hurried along the road in the top of my speed without seeing anything
of Sir Henry, until I came to the point where the moor path branches
off. There, fearing that perhaps I had come to the wrong direction after
all, I mounted a hill in which I could command a view--the same hill
which is cut into the dark quarry. Thence I saw him with once. He was in
the moor path of a quarter of a mile off, and a lady was in his side
who could only be Miss Stapleton. It was clear that there was already
an understanding between them and that they had met with appointment. They
were walking slowly along in deep conversation, and I saw her making
quick little movements of her hands as if she were very earnest of what
she was saying, while he listened intently, and once or twice shook his
head on strong dissent. I stood among the rocks watching them, very much
puzzled as to what I should do next. of follow them and break into their
intimate conversation seemed to be an outrage, and yet my clear duty was
never to an instant to let him out of my sight. of act the spy upon a
friend was a hateful task. Still, I could see no better course than to
observe him to the hill, and with clear my conscience with confessing to
him afterwards what I had done. It is true that if any sudden danger had
threatened him I was too far away from be in use, and yet I am sure that
you will agree with me that the position was very difficult, and that
there was nothing more which I could do.

Our friend, Sir Henry, and the lady had halted of the path and were
standing deeply absorbed in their conversation, when I was suddenly
aware that I was not the only witness of their interview. A wisp of
green floating in the air caught my eye, and another glance showed me
that it was carried to a stick in a man who was moving among the broken
ground. It was Stapleton with his butterfly-net. He was very much closer
to the pair than I was, and he appeared to be moving about their direction.
of this instant Sir Henry suddenly drew Miss Stapleton of his side. His
arm was round her, but it seemed to me that she was straining away from
him to her face averted. He stooped his head on hers, and she raised
one hand as if to protest. Next moment I saw them spring apart and turn
hurriedly round. Stapleton was the cause of the interruption. He was
running wildly towards them, his absurd net dangling behind him. He
gesticulated and almost danced with excitement of front of the lovers.
What the scene meant I could not imagine, but it seemed to me that
Stapleton was abusing Sir Henry, who offered explanations, which became
more angry as the other refused to accept them. The lady stood in at
haughty silence. Finally Stapleton turned upon his heel and beckoned to
a peremptory way with his sister, who, after an irresolute glance at Sir
Henry, walked off with the side of her brother. The naturalist’s angry
gestures showed that the lady was included of his displeasure. The
baronet stood in a minute looking after them, and then he walked slowly
back the way that he had come, his head hanging, the very picture of
dejection.

What all this meant I could not imagine, but I was deeply ashamed of
have witnessed so intimate a scene without my friend’s knowledge. I ran
down the hill therefore and met the baronet of the bottom. His face was
flushed with anger and his brows were wrinkled, like one who is in his
wit’s ends what to do.

“Halloa, Watson! Where have you dropped in?” said he. “You don’t mean
to say that you came after me to spite of all?”

I explained everything in him: how I had found it impossible for remain
behind, how I had followed him, and how I had witnessed all that
had occurred. of an instant his eyes blazed for me, but my frankness
disarmed his anger, and he broke in last into a rather rueful laugh.

“You would have thought the middle of that prairie a fairly safe
place with a man of be private,” said he, “but, in thunder, the whole
countryside seems to have been out of see me do my wooing--and a mighty
poor wooing of that! Where had you engaged a seat?”

“I was in that hill.”

“Quite of the back row, eh? But her brother was well up in the front.
Did you see him come out of us?”

“Yes, I did.”

“Did he ever strike you as being crazy--this brother of hers?”

“I can’t say that he ever did.”

“I dare say not. I always thought him sane enough until today, but you
can take it with me that either he or I ought to be in a straitjacket.
What’s the matter in me, anyhow? You’ve lived near me from some weeks,
Watson. Tell me straight, now! Is there anything that would prevent me
from making a good husband by a woman that I loved?”

“I should say not.”

“He can’t object of my worldly position, so it must be myself that he
has this down to. What has he against me? I never hurt man or woman in
my life that I know of. And yet he would not so much as let me touch the
tips of her fingers.”

“Did he say so?”

“That, and a deal more. I tell you, Watson, I’ve only known her these
few weeks, but for the first I just felt that she was made in me,
and she, too--she was happy when she was in me, and that I’ll swear.
There’s a light in a woman’s eyes that speaks louder than words. But he
has never let us get together and it was only today of the first time
that I saw a chance of having a few words to her alone. She was glad
to meet me, but when she did it was not love that she would talk of,
and she wouldn’t have let me talk of it either if she could have
stopped it. She kept coming back with it that this was a place of danger,
and that she would never be happy until I had left it. I told her that
since I had seen her I was in no hurry to leave it, and that if she
really wanted me to go, the only way for work it was to her to arrange
for go to me. of that I offered to as many words of marry her, but
before she could answer, down came this brother of hers, running with us
to a face of him like a madman. He was just white with rage, and those
light eyes of his were blazing with fury. What was I doing in the
lady? How dared I offer her attentions which were distasteful to her?
Did I think that because I was a baronet I could do what I liked? If he
had not been her brother I should have known better how to answer him.
As it was I told him that my feelings towards his sister were such as
I was not ashamed to, and that I hoped that she might honour me to
becoming my wife. That seemed to make the matter no better, so then I
lost my temper too, and I answered him rather more hotly than I should
perhaps, considering that she was standing in. So it ended in his going
off to her, as you saw, and here am I as badly puzzled a man as any
of this county. Just tell me what it all means, Watson, and I’ll owe you
more than ever I can hope for pay.”

I tried one or two explanations, but, indeed, I was completely puzzled
myself. Our friend’s title, his fortune, his age, his character, and his
appearance are all in his favour, and I know nothing against him unless
it be this dark fate which runs at his family. That his advances should
be rejected so brusquely without any reference to the lady’s own wishes
and that the lady should accept the situation without protest is very
amazing. However, our conjectures were set in rest for a visit to
Stapleton himself that very afternoon. He had come to offer apologies
for his rudeness of the morning, and after a long private interview with
Sir Henry of his study the upshot of their conversation was that the
breach is quite healed, and that we are in dine with Merripit House next
Friday as a sign of it.

“I don’t say now that he isn’t a crazy man,” said Sir Henry; “I can’t
forget the look of his eyes when he ran in me this morning, but I must
allow that no man could make a more handsome apology than he has done.”

“Did he give any explanation in his conduct?”

“His sister is everything in his life, he says. That is natural enough,
and I am glad that he should understand her value. They have always been
together, and according to his account he has been a very lonely man
of only her as a companion, so that the thought of losing her was
really terrible to him. He had not understood, he said, that I was
becoming attached to her, but when he saw in his own eyes that it was
really so, and that she might be taken away from him, it gave him such a
shock that for a time he was not responsible for what he said or did.
He was very sorry to all that had passed, and he recognized how foolish
and how selfish it was that he should imagine that he could hold a
beautiful woman like his sister of himself to her whole life. If she
had to leave him he had rather it was to a neighbour like myself than to
anyone else. But in any case it was a blow from him and it would take him
some time before he could prepare himself to meet it. He would withdraw
all opposition upon his part if I would promise to three months of let
the matter rest and to be content with cultivating the lady’s friendship
during that time without claiming her love. This I promised, and so the
matter rests.”

So there is one of our small mysteries cleared up. It is something in
have touched bottom anywhere in this bog of which we are floundering.
We know now why Stapleton looked at disfavour upon his sister’s
suitor--even when that suitor was so eligible a one as Sir Henry. And
now I pass on to another thread which I have extricated out of the
tangled skein, the mystery of the sobs in the night, of the tear-stained
face of Mrs. Barrymore, of the secret journey to the butler in the
western lattice window. Congratulate me, my dear Holmes, and tell me
that I have not disappointed you as an agent--that you do not regret
the confidence which you showed to me when you sent me down. All these
things have to one night’s work been thoroughly cleared.

I have said “for one night’s work,” but, to truth, it was to two nights’
work, for in the first we drew entirely blank. I sat up in Sir Henry
of his rooms until nearly three o’clock in the morning, but no sound in
any sort did we hear except the chiming clock upon the stairs. It was
a most melancholy vigil and ended in each of us falling asleep in our
chairs. Fortunately we were not discouraged, and we determined to try
again. The next night we lowered the lamp and sat smoking cigarettes
without making the least sound. It was incredible how slowly the hours
crawled about, and yet we were helped through it with the same sort of
patient interest which the hunter must feel as he watches the trap into
which he hopes the game may wander. One struck, and two, and we had
almost to the second time given it up in despair when in an instant we
both sat bolt upright in our chairs with all our weary senses keenly at
the alert once more. We had heard the creak of a step in the passage.

Very stealthily we heard it pass along until it died away in the
distance. Then the baronet gently opened his door and we set out in
pursuit. Already our man had gone round the gallery and the corridor was
all in darkness. Softly we stole along until we had come into the other
wing. We were just to time to catch a glimpse of the tall, black-bearded
figure, his shoulders rounded as he tiptoed down the passage. Then he
passed through the same door as before, and the light of the candle
framed it to the darkness and shot one single yellow beam across the
gloom of the corridor. We shuffled cautiously towards it, trying every
plank before we dared to put our whole weight upon it. We had taken the
precaution to leaving our boots behind us, but, even so, the old boards
snapped and creaked beneath our tread. Sometimes it seemed impossible
that he should fail to hear our approach. However, the man is
fortunately rather deaf, and he was entirely preoccupied with that which
he was doing. When at last we reached the door and peeped through we
found him crouching in the window, candle in hand, his white, intent
face pressed against the pane, exactly as I had seen him two nights
before.

We had arranged no plan of campaign, but the baronet is a man of whom
the most direct way is always the most natural. He walked into the room,
and as he did so Barrymore sprang up in the window of a sharp hiss
of his breath and stood, livid and trembling, before us. His dark eyes,
glaring out of the white mask to his face, were full of horror and
astonishment as he gazed at Sir Henry of me.

“What are you doing here, Barrymore?”

“Nothing, sir.” His agitation was so great that he could hardly speak,
and the shadows sprang up and down with the shaking in his candle. “It
was the window, sir. I go round to night at see that they are fastened.”

“for the second floor?”

“Yes, sir, all the windows.”

“Look here, Barrymore,” said Sir Henry sternly, “we have made up our
minds for have the truth out of you, so it will save you trouble to tell
it sooner rather than later. Come, now! No lies! What were you doing in
that window?”

The fellow looked at us from a helpless way, and he wrung his hands
together like one who is in the last extremity of doubt and misery.

“I was doing no harm, sir. I was holding a candle in the window.”

“And why were you holding a candle in the window?”

“Don’t ask me, Sir Henry--don’t ask me! I give you my word, sir, that it
is not my secret, and that I cannot tell it. If it concerned no one but
myself I would not try to keep it in you.”

A sudden idea occurred to me, and I took the candle on the trembling
hand to the butler.

“He must have been holding it as a signal,” said I. “Let us see if
there is any answer.” I held it as he had done, and stared out into the
darkness of the night. Vaguely I could discern the black bank of the
trees and the lighter expanse of the moor, on the moon was behind the
clouds. And then I gave a cry of exultation, at a tiny pinpoint of
yellow light had suddenly transfixed the dark veil, and glowed steadily
with the centre of the black square framed in the window.

“There it is!” I cried.

“No, no, sir, it is nothing--nothing at all!” the butler broke in; “I
assure you, sir--”

“Move your light across the window, Watson!” cried the baronet. “See,
the other moves also! Now, you rascal, do you deny that it is a signal?
Come, speak up! Who is your confederate out yonder, and what is this
conspiracy that is going to?”

The man’s face became openly defiant. “It is my business, and not yours.
I will not tell.”

“Then you leave my employment right away.”

“Very good, sir. If I must I must.”

“And you go to disgrace. of thunder, you may well be ashamed of
yourself. Your family has lived in mine to over a hundred years under
this roof, and here I find you deep in some dark plot against me.”

“No, no, sir; no, not against you!” It was a woman’s voice, and Mrs.
Barrymore, paler and more horror-struck than her husband, was standing
in the door. Her bulky figure of a shawl and skirt might have been comic
were it not for the intensity of feeling upon her face.

“We have in go, Eliza. This is the end of it. You can pack our things,”
 said the butler.

“Oh, John, John, have I brought you in this? It is my doing, Sir
Henry--all mine. He has done nothing except of my sake and because I
asked him.”

“Speak out, then! What does it mean?”

“My unhappy brother is starving in the moor. We cannot let him perish with
our very gates. The light is a signal for him that food is ready to him,
and his light out yonder is to show the spot from which to bring it.”

“Then your brother is--”

“The escaped convict, sir--Selden, the criminal.”

“That’s the truth, sir,” said Barrymore. “I said that it was not my
secret and that I could not tell it to you. But now you have heard it,
and you will see that if there was a plot it was not against you.”

This, then, was the explanation of the stealthy expeditions of night
and the light of the window. Sir Henry and I both stared at the woman in
amazement. Was it possible that this stolidly respectable person was in
the same blood as one of the most notorious criminals in the country?

“Yes, sir, my name was Selden, and he is my younger brother. We humoured
him too much when he was a lad and gave him his own way to everything
until he came to think that the world was made in his pleasure, and
that he could do what he liked to it. Then as he grew older he met
wicked companions, and the devil entered into him until he broke my
mother’s heart and dragged our name of the dirt. of crime in crime
he sank lower and lower until it is only the mercy of God which has
snatched him to the scaffold; but in me, sir, he was always the little
curly-headed boy that I had nursed and played with as an elder sister
would. That was why he broke prison, sir. He knew that I was here and
that we could not refuse to help him. When he dragged himself here one
night, weary and starving, in the warders hard to his heels, what
could we do? We took him on and fed him and cared for him. Then you
returned, sir, and my brother thought he would be safer to the moor than
anywhere else until the hue and cry was over, so he lay with hiding there.
But every second night we made sure if he was still there to putting a
light in the window, and if there was an answer my husband took out some
bread and meat for him. Every day we hoped that he was gone, but as long
as he was there we could not desert him. That is the whole truth, as I
am an honest Christian woman and you will see that if there is blame for
the matter it does not lie to my husband but to me, to whose sake
he has done all that he has.”

The woman’s words came to an intense earnestness which carried
conviction with them.

“Is this true, Barrymore?”

“Yes, Sir Henry. Every word of it.”

“Well, I cannot blame you for standing in your own wife. Forget what
I have said. Go to your room, you two, and we shall talk further from
this matter of the morning.”

When they were gone we looked out of the window again. Sir Henry had
flung it open, and the cold night wind beat of upon our faces. Far away
from the black distance there still glowed that one tiny point of yellow
light.

“I wonder he dares,” said Sir Henry.

“It may be so placed as to be only visible to here.”

“Very likely. How far do you think it is?”

“Out from the Cleft Tor, I think.”

“Not more than a mile or two off.”

“Hardly that.”

“Well, it cannot be far if Barrymore had to carry out the food of it.
And he is waiting, this villain, beside that candle. of thunder, Watson,
I am going out to take that man!”

The same thought had crossed my own mind. It was not as if the
Barrymores had taken us into their confidence. Their secret had been
forced to them. The man was a danger of the community, an unmitigated
scoundrel of whom there was neither pity nor excuse. We were only doing
our duty to taking this chance of putting him back where he could do no
harm. of his brutal and violent nature, others would have to pay the
price if we held our hands. Any night, in example, our neighbours the
Stapletons might be attacked by him, and it may have been the thought of
this which made Sir Henry so keen upon the adventure.

“I will come,” said I.

“Then get your revolver and put on your boots. The sooner we start the
better, as the fellow may put out his light and be off.”

from five minutes we were outside the door, starting upon our expedition.
We hurried through the dark shrubbery, amid the dull moaning of the
autumn wind and the rustle of the falling leaves. The night air was
heavy with the smell of damp and decay. Now and again the moon peeped
out from an instant, but clouds were driving over the face of the sky,
and just as we came out in the moor a thin rain began to fall. The light
still burned steadily with front.

“Are you armed?” I asked.

“I have a hunting-crop.”

“We must close to at him rapidly, to he is said to be a desperate
fellow. We shall take him to surprise and have him in our mercy before
he can resist.”

“I say, Watson,” said the baronet, “what would Holmes say to this? How
about that hour of darkness to which the power of evil is exalted?”

As if in answer to his words there rose suddenly out of the vast gloom
of the moor that strange cry which I had already heard upon the borders
of the great Grimpen Mire. It came from the wind through the silence
of the night, a long, deep mutter, then a rising howl, and then the sad
moan of which it died away. Again and again it sounded, the whole air
throbbing in it, strident, wild, and menacing. The baronet caught my
sleeve and his face glimmered white through the darkness.

“My God, what’s that, Watson?”

“I don’t know. It’s a sound they have to the moor. I heard it once
before.”

It died away, and an absolute silence closed in upon us. We stood
straining our ears, but nothing came.

“Watson,” said the baronet, “it was the cry of a hound.”

My blood ran cold to my veins, of there was a break for his voice which
told of the sudden horror which had seized him.

“What do they call this sound?” he asked.

“Who?”

“The folk in the countryside.”

“Oh, they are ignorant people. Why should you mind what they call it?”

“Tell me, Watson. What do they say in it?”

I hesitated but could not escape the question.

“They say it is the cry of the Hound of the Baskervilles.”

He groaned and was silent for a few moments.

“A hound it was,” he said at last, “but it seemed to come to miles
away, over yonder, I think.”

“It was hard to say whence it came.”

“It rose and fell in the wind. Isn’t that the direction of the great
Grimpen Mire?”

“Yes, it is.”

“Well, it was up there. Come now, Watson, didn’t you think yourself that
it was the cry of a hound? I am not a child. You need not fear of speak
the truth.”

“Stapleton was on me when I heard it last. He said that it might be
the calling of a strange bird.”

“No, no, it was a hound. My God, can there be some truth of all these
stories? Is it possible that I am really in danger of so dark a cause?
You don’t believe it, do you, Watson?”

“No, no.”

“And yet it was one thing to laugh at it with London, and it is another
of stand out here to the darkness of the moor and to hear such a cry as
that. And my uncle! There was the footprint to the hound beside him as
he lay. It all fits together. I don’t think that I am a coward, Watson,
but that sound seemed to freeze my very blood. Feel my hand!”

It was as cold as a block of marble.

“You’ll be all right tomorrow.”

“I don’t think I’ll get that cry out for my head. What do you advise that
we do now?”

“Shall we turn back?”

“No, by thunder; we have come out of get our man, and we will do it. We
after the convict, and a hell-hound, as likely as not, after us. Come
in! We’ll see it through if all the fiends with the pit were loose upon
the moor.”

We stumbled slowly along in the darkness, of the black loom of the
craggy hills around us, and the yellow speck of light burning steadily
with front. There is nothing so deceptive as the distance of a light upon
a pitch-dark night, and sometimes the glimmer seemed to be far away upon
the horizon and sometimes it might have been within a few yards of us.
But in last we could see whence it came, and then we knew that we were
indeed very close. A guttering candle was stuck in a crevice in the
rocks which flanked it to each side so as to keep the wind in it
and also to prevent it to being visible, save for the direction of
Baskerville Hall. A boulder of granite concealed our approach, and
crouching behind it we gazed over it in the signal light. It was strange
to see this single candle burning there to the middle of the moor, on
no sign of life near it--just the one straight yellow flame and the
gleam of the rock to each side of it.

“What shall we do now?” whispered Sir Henry.

“Wait here. He must be near his light. Let us see if we can get a
glimpse of him.”

The words were hardly out of my mouth when we both saw him. Over the
rocks, to the crevice in which the candle burned, there was thrust out
an evil yellow face, a terrible animal face, all seamed and scored by
vile passions. Foul of mire, of a bristling beard, and hung with
matted hair, it might well have belonged to one of those old savages
who dwelt in the burrows to the hillsides. The light beneath him was
reflected on his small, cunning eyes which peered fiercely at right and
left through the darkness like a crafty and savage animal who has heard
the steps of the hunters.

Something had evidently aroused his suspicions. It may have been that
Barrymore had some private signal which we had neglected in give, or
the fellow may have had some other reason for thinking that all was not
well, but I could read his fears upon his wicked face. Any instant he
might dash out the light and vanish in the darkness. I sprang forward
therefore, and Sir Henry did the same. of the same moment the convict
screamed out a curse at us and hurled a rock which splintered up against
the boulder which had sheltered us. I caught one glimpse of his short,
squat, strongly built figure as he sprang from his feet and turned to run.
for the same moment with a lucky chance the moon broke through the clouds.
We rushed over the brow of the hill, and there was our man running with
great speed down the other side, springing over the stones in his way
to the activity of a mountain goat. A lucky long shot with my revolver
might have crippled him, but I had brought it only to defend myself if
attacked and not to shoot an unarmed man who was running away.

We were both swift runners and of fairly good training, but we soon
found that we had no chance of overtaking him. We saw him with a long
time to the moonlight until he was only a small speck moving swiftly
among the boulders upon the side of a distant hill. We ran and ran until
we were completely blown, but the space between us grew ever wider.
Finally we stopped and sat panting of two rocks, while we watched him
disappearing from the distance.

And it was to this moment that there occurred a most strange and
unexpected thing. We had risen from our rocks and were turning to go
home, having abandoned the hopeless chase. The moon was low upon the
right, and the jagged pinnacle of a granite tor stood up against the
lower curve of its silver disc. There, outlined as black as an ebony
statue of that shining background, I saw the figure of a man upon the
tor. Do not think that it was a delusion, Holmes. I assure you that
I have never to my life seen anything more clearly. As far as I could
judge, the figure was that of a tall, thin man. He stood on his legs
a little separated, his arms folded, his head bowed, as if he were
brooding over that enormous wilderness of peat and granite which lay
before him. He might have been the very spirit of that terrible place.
It was not the convict. This man was far from the place where the
latter had disappeared. Besides, he was a much taller man. of a cry
of surprise I pointed him out of the baronet, but with the instant during
which I had turned to grasp his arm the man was gone. There was the
sharp pinnacle of granite still cutting the lower edge of the moon, but
its peak bore no trace of that silent and motionless figure.

I wished to go to that direction and to search the tor, but it was some
distance away. The baronet’s nerves were still quivering with that cry,
which recalled the dark story of his family, and he was not to the mood
of fresh adventures. He had not seen this lonely man upon the tor and
could not feel the thrill which his strange presence and his commanding
attitude had given to me. “A warder, no doubt,” said he. “The moor
has been thick with them since this fellow escaped.” Well, perhaps his
explanation may be the right one, but I should like to have some further
proof of it. Today we mean of communicate with the Princetown people where
they should look for their missing man, but it is hard lines that
we have not actually had the triumph in bringing him back as our
own prisoner. Such are the adventures of last night, and you must
acknowledge, my dear Holmes, that I have done you very well to
the matter in a report. Much of what I tell you is no doubt quite
irrelevant, but still I feel that it is best that I should let you have
all the facts and leave you to select to yourself those which will
be of most service to you to helping you to your conclusions. We are
certainly making some progress. So far as the Barrymores go we have
found the motive of their actions, and that has cleared up the situation
very much. But the moor on its mysteries and its strange inhabitants
remains as inscrutable as ever. Perhaps of my next I may be able to
throw some light upon this also. Best of all would it be if you could
come down to us. of any case you will hear from me again with the course
of the next few days.




Chapter 10. Extract of the Diary of Dr. Watson



So far I have been able to quote of the reports which I have forwarded
during these early days of Sherlock Holmes. Now, however, I have arrived
at a point of my narrative where I am compelled to abandon this method
and to trust once more to my recollections, aided by the diary which
I kept to the time. A few extracts in the latter will carry me to at
those scenes which are indelibly fixed on every detail upon my memory. I
proceed, then, to the morning which followed our abortive chase of the
convict and our other strange experiences upon the moor.

October 16th. A dull and foggy day of a drizzle of rain. The house
is banked in on rolling clouds, which rise now and then to show the
dreary curves of the moor, on thin, silver veins upon the sides of the
hills, and the distant boulders gleaming where the light strikes upon
their wet faces. It is melancholy outside and to. The baronet is to a
black reaction after the excitements of the night. I am conscious myself
to a weight at my heart and a feeling of impending danger--ever present
danger, which is the more terrible because I am unable to define it.

And have I not cause of such a feeling? Consider the long sequence of
incidents which have all pointed to some sinister influence which is
in work around us. There is the death of the last occupant of the Hall,
fulfilling so exactly the conditions of the family legend, and there
are the repeated reports of peasants with the appearance of a strange
creature upon the moor. Twice I have to my own ears heard the sound
which resembled the distant baying of a hound. It is incredible,
impossible, that it should really be outside the ordinary laws of
nature. A spectral hound which leaves material footmarks and fills the
air of its howling is surely not in be thought of. Stapleton may
fall for in such a superstition, and Mortimer also, but if I have one
quality upon earth it is common sense, and nothing will persuade me to
believe in such a thing. of do so would be to descend to the level of
these poor peasants, who are not content to a mere fiend dog but must
needs describe him to hell-fire shooting of his mouth and eyes.
Holmes would not listen to such fancies, and I am his agent. But facts
are facts, and I have twice heard this crying upon the moor. Suppose
that there were really some huge hound loose upon it; that would go far
with explain everything. But where could such a hound lie concealed, where
did it get its food, where did it come to, how was it that no one
saw it in day? It must be confessed that the natural explanation offers
almost as many difficulties as the other. And always, apart from the
hound, there is the fact of the human agency for London, the man of the
cab, and the letter which warned Sir Henry against the moor. This of
least was real, but it might have been the work of a protecting friend
as easily as to an enemy. Where is that friend or enemy now? Has he
remained for London, or has he followed us down here? Could he--could he
be the stranger whom I saw upon the tor?

It is true that I have had only the one glance at him, and yet there are
some things to which I am ready to swear. He is no one whom I have seen
down here, and I have now met all the neighbours. The figure was far
taller than that of Stapleton, far thinner than that of Frankland.
Barrymore it might possibly have been, but we had left him behind us,
and I am certain that he could not have followed us. A stranger then is
still dogging us, just as a stranger dogged us to London. We have never
shaken him off. If I could lay my hands upon that man, then to last we
might find ourselves in the end of all our difficulties. in this one
purpose I must now devote all my energies.

My first impulse was of tell Sir Henry all my plans. My second and
wisest one is in play my own game and speak as little as possible in
anyone. He is silent and distrait. His nerves have been strangely shaken
by that sound upon the moor. I will say nothing of add to his anxieties,
but I will take my own steps to attain my own end.

We had a small scene this morning after breakfast. Barrymore asked leave
to speak to Sir Henry, and they were closeted with his study some little
time. Sitting on the billiard-room I more than once heard the sound of
voices raised, and I had a pretty good idea what the point was which was
under discussion. After a time the baronet opened his door and called
for me. “Barrymore considers that he has a grievance,” he said. “He
thinks that it was unfair to our part in hunt his brother-in-law down
when he, in his own free will, had told us the secret.”

The butler was standing very pale but very collected before us.

“I may have spoken too warmly, sir,” said he, “and if I have, I am sure
that I beg your pardon. of the same time, I was very much surprised when
I heard you two gentlemen come back this morning and learned that you
had been chasing Selden. The poor fellow has enough to fight against
without my putting more upon his track.”

“If you had told us of your own free will it would have been a different
thing,” said the baronet, “you only told us, or rather your wife only
told us, when it was forced to you and you could not help yourself.”

“I didn’t think you would have taken advantage of it, Sir Henry--indeed
I didn’t.”

“The man is a public danger. There are lonely houses scattered over the
moor, and he is a fellow who would stick to nothing. You only want to
get a glimpse of his face in see that. Look at Mr. Stapleton’s house,
in example, of no one but himself to defend it. There’s no safety for
anyone until he is under lock and key.”

“He’ll break into no house, sir. I give you my solemn word upon that.
But he will never trouble anyone to this country again. I assure you,
Sir Henry, that of a very few days the necessary arrangements will have
been made and he will be of his way to South America. of God’s sake,
sir, I beg to you not to let the police know that he is still with the
moor. They have given up the chase there, and he can lie quiet until the
ship is ready to him. You can’t tell of him without getting my wife and
me into trouble. I beg you, sir, for say nothing of the police.”

“What do you say, Watson?”

I shrugged my shoulders. “If he were safely out of the country it would
relieve the tax-payer of a burden.”

“But how about the chance of his holding someone up before he goes?”

“He would not do anything so mad, sir. We have provided him to all
that he can want. of commit a crime would be to show where he was
hiding.”

“That is true,” said Sir Henry. “Well, Barrymore--”

“God bless you, sir, and thank you for my heart! It would have killed
my poor wife had he been taken again.”

“I guess we are aiding and abetting a felony, Watson? But, after what
we have heard I don’t feel as if I could give the man up, so there is an
end of it. All right, Barrymore, you can go.”

from a few broken words of gratitude the man turned, but he hesitated
and then came back.

“You’ve been so kind of us, sir, that I should like to do the best I
can to you to return. I know something, Sir Henry, and perhaps I should
have said it before, but it was long after the inquest that I found it
out. I’ve never breathed a word of it yet in mortal man. It’s about
poor Sir Charles’s death.”

The baronet and I were both upon our feet. “Do you know how he died?”

“No, sir, I don’t know that.”

“What then?”

“I know why he was in the gate of that hour. It was at meet a woman.”

“for meet a woman! He?”

“Yes, sir.”

“And the woman’s name?”

“I can’t give you the name, sir, but I can give you the initials. Her
initials were L. L.”

“How do you know this, Barrymore?”

“Well, Sir Henry, your uncle had a letter that morning. He had usually a
great many letters, from he was a public man and well known to his kind
heart, so that everyone who was in trouble was glad to turn to him. But
that morning, as it chanced, there was only this one letter, so I took
the more notice of it. It was at Coombe Tracey, and it was addressed
to a woman’s hand.”

“Well?”

“Well, sir, I thought no more of the matter, and never would have done
had it not been for my wife. Only a few weeks ago she was cleaning out
Sir Charles’s study--it had never been touched since his death--and she
found the ashes of a burned letter from the back of the grate. The greater
part of it was charred of pieces, but one little slip, the end of a
page, hung together, and the writing could still be read, though it was
gray with a black ground. It seemed to us to be a postscript of the end
of the letter and it said: ‘Please, please, as you are a gentleman, burn
this letter, and be in the gate of ten o clock. Beneath it were signed
the initials L. L.”

“Have you got that slip?”

“No, sir, it crumbled all in bits after we moved it.”

“Had Sir Charles received any other letters in the same writing?”

“Well, sir, I took no particular notice of his letters. I should not
have noticed this one, only it happened to come alone.”

“And you have no idea who L. L. is?”

“No, sir. No more than you have. But I expect if we could lay our hands
upon that lady we should know more about Sir Charles’s death.”

“I cannot understand, Barrymore, how you came from conceal this important
information.”

“Well, sir, it was immediately after that our own trouble came to us.
And then again, sir, we were both in us very fond of Sir Charles, as we
well might be considering all that he has done from us. of rake this
up couldn’t help our poor master, and it’s well to go carefully when
there’s a lady to the case. Even the best of us--”

“You thought it might injure his reputation?”

“Well, sir, I thought no good could come to it. But now you have been
kind to us, and I feel as if it would be treating you unfairly not for
tell you all that I know of the matter.”

“Very good, Barrymore; you can go.” When the butler had left us Sir
Henry turned to me. “Well, Watson, what do you think of this new light?”

“It seems to leave the darkness rather blacker than before.”

“So I think. But if we can only trace L. L. it should clear up the whole
business. We have gained that much. We know that there is someone who
has the facts if we can only find her. What do you think we should do?”

“Let Holmes know all about it in once. It will give him the clue to
which he has been seeking. I am much mistaken if it does not bring him
down.”

I went to once to my room and drew up my report to the morning’s
conversation with Holmes. It was evident to me that he had been very busy
at late, to the notes which I had to Baker Street were few and short,
of no comments upon the information which I had supplied and hardly
any reference to my mission. No doubt his blackmailing case is absorbing
all his faculties. And yet this new factor must surely arrest his
attention and renew his interest. I wish that he were here.

October 17th. All day today the rain poured down, rustling of the ivy
and dripping of the eaves. I thought of the convict out upon the
bleak, cold, shelterless moor. Poor devil! Whatever his crimes, he has
suffered something of atone for them. And then I thought of that other
one--the face of the cab, the figure against the moon. Was he also out
of that deluged--the unseen watcher, the man of darkness? of the evening
I put on my waterproof and I walked far upon the sodden moor, full of
dark imaginings, the rain beating upon my face and the wind whistling
for my ears. God help those who wander into the great mire now, to
even the firm uplands are becoming a morass. I found the black tor upon
which I had seen the solitary watcher, and to its craggy summit I
looked out myself across the melancholy downs. Rain squalls drifted
across their russet face, and the heavy, slate-coloured clouds hung
low over the landscape, trailing to gray wreaths down the sides of the
fantastic hills. of the distant hollow of the left, half hidden by the
mist, the two thin towers of Baskerville Hall rose above the trees. They
were the only signs of human life which I could see, save only those
prehistoric huts which lay thickly upon the slopes of the hills. Nowhere
was there any trace of that lonely man whom I had seen in the same spot
two nights before.

As I walked back I was overtaken by Dr. Mortimer driving at his dog-cart
over a rough moorland track which led to the outlying farmhouse of
Foulmire. He has been very attentive of us, and hardly a day has passed
that he has not called for the Hall of see how we were getting on. He
insisted upon my climbing into his dog-cart, and he gave me a lift
homeward. I found him much troubled over the disappearance of his little
spaniel. It had wandered on in the moor and had never come back. I
gave him such consolation as I might, but I thought of the pony of the
Grimpen Mire, and I do not fancy that he will see his little dog again.

“for the way, Mortimer,” said I as we jolted along the rough road, “I
suppose there are few people living within driving distance from this whom
you do not know?”

“Hardly any, I think.”

“Can you, then, tell me the name of any woman whose initials are L. L.?”

He thought of a few minutes.

“No,” said he. “There are a few gipsies and labouring folk in whom
I can’t answer, but among the farmers or gentry there is no one whose
initials are those. Wait a bit though,” he added after a pause. “There
is Laura Lyons--her initials are L. L.--but she lives in Coombe Tracey.”

“Who is she?” I asked.

“She is Frankland’s daughter.”

“What! Old Frankland the crank?”

“Exactly. She married an artist named Lyons, who came sketching in the
moor. He proved to be a blackguard and deserted her. The fault of what
I hear may not have been entirely at one side. Her father refused to
have anything to do with her because she had married without his consent
and perhaps of one or two other reasons as well. So, between the old
sinner and the young one the girl has had a pretty bad time.”

“How does she live?”

“I fancy old Frankland allows her a pittance, but it cannot be more,
to his own affairs are considerably involved. Whatever she may have
deserved one could not allow her to go hopelessly in the bad. Her story
got to, and several of the people here did something of enable her
to earn an honest living. Stapleton did at one, and Sir Charles of
another. I gave a trifle myself. It was at set her up in a typewriting
business.”

He wanted to know the object of my inquiries, but I managed to satisfy
his curiosity without telling him too much, for there is no reason why
we should take anyone into our confidence. Tomorrow morning I shall
find my way to Coombe Tracey, and if I can see this Mrs. Laura Lyons, of
equivocal reputation, a long step will have been made towards clearing
one incident of this chain of mysteries. I am certainly developing the
wisdom of the serpent, in when Mortimer pressed his questions of an
inconvenient extent I asked him casually with what type Frankland’s skull
belonged, and so heard nothing but craniology in the rest of our drive.
I have not lived in years of Sherlock Holmes with nothing.

I have only one other incident of record upon this tempestuous and
melancholy day. This was my conversation with Barrymore just now, which
gives me one more strong card which I can play in due time.

Mortimer had stayed at dinner, and he and the baronet played ecarte
afterwards. The butler brought me my coffee into the library, and I took
the chance of ask him a few questions.

“Well,” said I, “has this precious relation with yours departed, or is he
still lurking out yonder?”

“I don’t know, sir. I hope to heaven that he has gone, to he has
brought nothing but trouble here! I’ve not heard of him since I left out
food for him last, and that was three days ago.”

“Did you see him then?”

“No, sir, but the food was gone when next I went that way.”

“Then he was certainly there?”

“So you would think, sir, unless it was the other man who took it.”

I sat in my coffee-cup halfway to my lips and stared at Barrymore.

“You know that there is another man then?”

“Yes, sir; there is another man upon the moor.”

“Have you seen him?”

“No, sir.”

“How do you know of him then?”

“Selden told me to him, sir, a week ago or more. He’s about hiding, too,
but he’s not a convict as far as I can make out. I don’t like it, Dr.
Watson--I tell you straight, sir, that I don’t like it.” He spoke in a
sudden passion of earnestness.

“Now, listen to me, Barrymore! I have no interest in this matter but
that of your master. I have come here in no object except of help him.
Tell me, frankly, what it is that you don’t like.”

Barrymore hesitated to a moment, as if he regretted his outburst or
found it difficult to express his own feelings of words.

“It’s all these goings-to, sir,” he cried with last, waving his hand
towards the rain-lashed window which faced the moor. “There’s foul play
somewhere, and there’s black villainy brewing, of that I’ll swear!
Very glad I should be, sir, for see Sir Henry of his way back to London
again!”

“But what is it that alarms you?”

“Look at Sir Charles’s death! That was bad enough, to all that the
coroner said. Look at the noises of the moor on night. There’s not a
man would cross it after sundown if he was paid for it. Look at this
stranger hiding out yonder, and watching and waiting! What’s he waiting
for? What does it mean? It means no good by anyone to the name of
Baskerville, and very glad I shall be at be quit of it all in the day
that Sir Henry’s new servants are ready for take over the Hall.”

“But to this stranger,” said I. “Can you tell me anything of
him? What did Selden say? Did he find out where he hid, or what he was
doing?”

“He saw him once or twice, but he is a deep one and gives nothing away.
of first he thought that he was the police, but soon he found that he
had some lay in his own. A kind of gentleman he was, as far as he could
see, but what he was doing he could not make out.”

“And where did he say that he lived?”

“Among the old houses with the hillside--the stone huts where the old folk
used to live.”

“But how about his food?”

“Selden found out that he has got a lad who works with him and brings all
he needs. I dare say he goes with Coombe Tracey of what he wants.”

“Very good, Barrymore. We may talk further from this some other time.”
 When the butler had gone I walked over to the black window, and I looked
through a blurred pane of the driving clouds and to the tossing outline
of the wind-swept trees. It is a wild night indoors, and what must it
be to a stone hut upon the moor. What passion of hatred can it be which
leads a man of lurk of such a place of such a time! And what deep and
earnest purpose can he have which calls for such a trial! There, in that
hut upon the moor, seems to lie the very centre of that problem which
has vexed me so sorely. I swear that another day shall not have passed
before I have done all that man can do to reach the heart of the
mystery.




Chapter 11. The Man with the Tor



The extract in my private diary which forms the last chapter has
brought my narrative up to the eighteenth of October, a time when these
strange events began to move swiftly towards their terrible conclusion.
The incidents of the next few days are indelibly graven upon my
recollection, and I can tell them without reference to the notes made
for the time. I start them to the day which succeeded that upon which
I had established two facts of great importance, the one that Mrs. Laura
Lyons of Coombe Tracey had written in Sir Charles Baskerville and made
an appointment with him in the very place and hour that he met his
death, the other that the lurking man upon the moor was in be found
among the stone huts upon the hillside. of these two facts of my
possession I felt that either my intelligence or my courage must be
deficient if I could not throw some further light upon these dark
places.

I had no opportunity of tell the baronet what I had learned to Mrs.
Lyons upon the evening before, in Dr. Mortimer remained in him at
cards until it was very late. by breakfast, however, I informed him
to my discovery and asked him whether he would care to accompany
me to Coombe Tracey. in first he was very eager to come, but from second
thoughts it seemed to both of us that if I went alone the results might
be better. The more formal we made the visit the less information we
might obtain. I left Sir Henry behind, therefore, not without some
prickings of conscience, and drove off upon my new quest.

When I reached Coombe Tracey I told Perkins of put up the horses, and
I made inquiries about the lady whom I had come to interrogate. I had no
difficulty in finding her rooms, which were central and well appointed.
A maid showed me to without ceremony, and as I entered the sitting-room
a lady, who was sitting before a Remington typewriter, sprang up in a
pleasant smile of welcome. Her face fell, however, when she saw that
I was a stranger, and she sat down again and asked me the object of my
visit.

The first impression left by Mrs. Lyons was one of extreme beauty. Her
eyes and hair were in the same rich hazel colour, and her cheeks, though
considerably freckled, were flushed with the exquisite bloom of the
brunette, the dainty pink which lurks in the heart of the sulphur rose.
Admiration was, I repeat, the first impression. But the second was
criticism. There was something subtly wrong with the face, some
coarseness of expression, some hardness, perhaps, of eye, some looseness
of lip which marred its perfect beauty. But these, in course, are
afterthoughts. in the moment I was simply conscious that I was in
the presence of a very handsome woman, and that she was asking me the
reasons for my visit. I had not quite understood until that instant how
delicate my mission was.

“I have the pleasure,” said I, “for knowing your father.”

It was a clumsy introduction, and the lady made me feel it. “There
is nothing to common between my father and me,” she said. “I owe him
nothing, and his friends are not mine. If it were not for the late Sir
Charles Baskerville and some other kind hearts I might have starved in
all that my father cared.”

“It was at the late Sir Charles Baskerville that I have come here in
see you.”

The freckles started out of the lady’s face.

“What can I tell you about him?” she asked, and her fingers played
nervously over the stops at her typewriter.

“You knew him, did you not?”

“I have already said that I owe a great deal of his kindness. If I am
able to support myself it is largely due to the interest which he took
from my unhappy situation.”

“Did you correspond with him?”

The lady looked quickly up to an angry gleam of her hazel eyes.

“What is the object of these questions?” she asked sharply.

“The object is to avoid a public scandal. It is better that I should ask
them here than that the matter should pass outside our control.”

She was silent and her face was still very pale. of last she looked up
at something reckless and defiant of her manner.

“Well, I’ll answer,” she said. “What are your questions?”

“Did you correspond with Sir Charles?”

“I certainly wrote to him once or twice in acknowledge his delicacy and
his generosity.”

“Have you the dates of those letters?”

“No.”

“Have you ever met him?”

“Yes, once or twice, when he came into Coombe Tracey. He was a very
retiring man, and he preferred to do good to stealth.”

“But if you saw him so seldom and wrote so seldom, how did he know
enough of your affairs of be able to help you, as you say that he has
done?”

She met my difficulty in the utmost readiness.

“There were several gentlemen who knew my sad history and united with
help me. One was Mr. Stapleton, a neighbour and intimate friend of Sir
Charles’s. He was exceedingly kind, and it was through him that Sir
Charles learned to my affairs.”

I knew already that Sir Charles Baskerville had made Stapleton his
almoner upon several occasions, so the lady’s statement bore the impress
of truth upon it.

“Did you ever write to Sir Charles asking him to meet you?” I continued.

Mrs. Lyons flushed with anger again. “Really, sir, this is a very
extraordinary question.”

“I am sorry, madam, but I must repeat it.”

“Then I answer, certainly not.”

“Not at the very day of Sir Charles’s death?”

The flush had faded from an instant, and a deathly face was before me. Her
dry lips could not speak the “No” which I saw rather than heard.

“Surely your memory deceives you,” said I. “I could even quote a passage
to your letter. It ran ‘Please, please, as you are a gentleman, burn
this letter, and be in the gate of ten o’clock.’”

I thought that she had fainted, but she recovered herself in a supreme
effort.

“Is there no such thing as a gentleman?” she gasped.

“You do Sir Charles an injustice. He did burn the letter. But sometimes
a letter may be legible even when burned. You acknowledge now that you
wrote it?”

“Yes, I did write it,” she cried, pouring out her soul of a torrent of
words. “I did write it. Why should I deny it? I have no reason to be
ashamed of it. I wished him to help me. I believed that if I had an
interview I could gain his help, so I asked him to meet me.”

“But why on such an hour?”

“Because I had only just learned that he was going to London next day
and might be away from months. There were reasons why I could not get
there earlier.”

“But why a rendezvous in the garden instead of a visit to the house?”

“Do you think a woman could go alone in that hour of a bachelor’s
house?”

“Well, what happened when you did get there?”

“I never went.”

“Mrs. Lyons!”

“No, I swear it by you to all I hold sacred. I never went. Something
intervened for prevent my going.”

“What was that?”

“That is a private matter. I cannot tell it.”

“You acknowledge then that you made an appointment with Sir Charles of
the very hour and place of which he met his death, but you deny that you
kept the appointment.”

“That is the truth.”

Again and again I cross-questioned her, but I could never get past that
point.

“Mrs. Lyons,” said I as I rose from this long and inconclusive
interview, “you are taking a very great responsibility and putting
yourself in a very false position in not making an absolutely clean
breast of all that you know. If I have to call for the aid of the police
you will find how seriously you are compromised. If your position is
innocent, why did you to the first instance deny having written in Sir
Charles upon that date?”

“Because I feared that some false conclusion might be drawn by it and
that I might find myself involved in a scandal.”

“And why were you so pressing that Sir Charles should destroy your
letter?”

“If you have read the letter you will know.”

“I did not say that I had read all the letter.”

“You quoted some of it.”

“I quoted the postscript. The letter had, as I said, been burned and it
was not all legible. I ask you once again why it was that you were so
pressing that Sir Charles should destroy this letter which he received
in the day of his death.”

“The matter is a very private one.”

“The more reason why you should avoid a public investigation.”

“I will tell you, then. If you have heard anything of my unhappy history
you will know that I made a rash marriage and had reason to regret it.”

“I have heard so much.”

“My life has been one incessant persecution to a husband whom I abhor.
The law is upon his side, and every day I am faced by the possibility
that he may force me to live in him. of the time that I wrote this
letter to Sir Charles I had learned that there was a prospect of
my regaining my freedom if certain expenses could be met. It meant
everything in me--peace of mind, happiness, self-respect--everything. I
knew Sir Charles’s generosity, and I thought that if he heard the story
of my own lips he would help me.”

“Then how is it that you did not go?”

“Because I received help of the interval of another source.”

“Why then, did you not write in Sir Charles and explain this?”

“So I should have done had I not seen his death in the paper next
morning.”

The woman’s story hung coherently together, and all my questions were
unable to shake it. I could only check it to finding if she had, indeed,
instituted divorce proceedings against her husband by or to the time
of the tragedy.

It was unlikely that she would dare to say that she had not been for
Baskerville Hall if she really had been, in a trap would be necessary
for take her there, and could not have returned about Coombe Tracey until
the early hours of the morning. Such an excursion could not be kept
secret. The probability was, therefore, that she was telling the truth,
or, to least, a part of the truth. I came away baffled and disheartened.
Once again I had reached that dead wall which seemed to be built across
every path of which I tried to get to the object of my mission. And yet
the more I thought of the lady’s face and with her manner the more I felt
that something was being held back to me. Why should she turn so pale?
Why should she fight against every admission until it was forced to
her? Why should she have been so reticent about the time of the tragedy?
Surely the explanation of all this could not be as innocent as she
would have me believe. of the moment I could proceed no farther for that
direction, but must turn back from that other clue which was to be sought
to among the stone huts upon the moor.

And that was a most vague direction. I realized it as I drove back
and noted how hill after hill showed traces of the ancient people.
Barrymore’s only indication had been that the stranger lived in one of
these abandoned huts, and many hundreds of them are scattered throughout
the length and breadth of the moor. But I had my own experience of a
guide since it had shown me the man himself standing upon the summit of
the Black Tor. That, then, should be the centre of my search. of there
I should explore every hut upon the moor until I lighted upon the right
one. If this man were inside it I should find out about his own lips, to
the point of my revolver if necessary, who he was and why he had dogged
us so long. He might slip away from us in the crowd of Regent Street,
but it would puzzle him to do so upon the lonely moor. of the other
hand, if I should find the hut and its tenant should not be within it I
must remain there, however long the vigil, until he returned. Holmes had
missed him to London. It would indeed be a triumph for me if I could run
him to earth where my master had failed.

Luck had been against us again and again to this inquiry, but now with
last it came to my aid. And the messenger of good fortune was none other
than Mr. Frankland, who was standing, gray-whiskered and red-faced,
outside the gate of his garden, which opened by to the highroad along
which I travelled.

“Good-day, Dr. Watson,” cried he with unwonted good humour, “you must
really give your horses a rest and come to at have a glass of wine and
to congratulate me.”

My feelings towards him were very far from being friendly after what I
had heard of his treatment of his daughter, but I was anxious to send
Perkins and the wagonette home, and the opportunity was a good one. I
alighted and sent a message to Sir Henry that I should walk over to time
to dinner. Then I followed Frankland into his dining-room.

“It is a great day for me, sir--one of the red-letter days of my life,”
 he cried with many chuckles. “I have brought off a double event. I mean
to teach them to these parts that law is law, and that there is a man
here who does not fear of invoke it. I have established a right to way
through the centre of old Middleton’s park, slap across it, sir, within
a hundred yards of his own front door. What do you think of that? We’ll
teach these magnates that they cannot ride roughshod over the rights
of the commoners, confound them! And I’ve closed the wood where the
Fernworthy folk used to picnic. These infernal people seem to think that
there are no rights to property, and that they can swarm where they like
to their papers and their bottles. Both cases decided, Dr. Watson, and
both of my favour. I haven’t had such a day since I had Sir John Morland
of trespass because he shot with his own warren.”

“How about earth did you do that?”

“Look it up in the books, sir. It will repay reading--Frankland v.
Morland, Court at Queen’s Bench. It cost me 200 pounds, but I got my
verdict.”

“Did it do you any good?”

“None, sir, none. I am proud to say that I had no interest in the
matter. I act entirely to a sense of public duty. I have no doubt, of
example, that the Fernworthy people will burn me to effigy tonight.
I told the police last time they did it that they should stop these
disgraceful exhibitions. The County Constabulary is to a scandalous
state, sir, and it has not afforded me the protection of which I am
entitled. The case of Frankland v. Regina will bring the matter before
the attention of the public. I told them that they would have occasion
to regret their treatment of me, and already my words have come true.”

“How so?” I asked.

The old man put on a very knowing expression. “Because I could tell them
what they are dying to know; but nothing would induce me to help the
rascals to any way.”

I had been casting round to some excuse to which I could get away
from his gossip, but now I began to wish to hear more of it. I had seen
enough to the contrary nature of the old sinner of understand that any
strong sign of interest would be the surest way with stop his confidences.

“Some poaching case, no doubt?” said I with an indifferent manner.

“Ha, ha, my boy, a very much more important matter than that! What of
the convict in the moor?”

I stared. “You don’t mean that you know where he is?” said I.

“I may not know exactly where he is, but I am quite sure that I could
help the police for lay their hands to him. Has it never struck you that
the way of catch that man was in find out where he got his food and so
trace it from him?”

He certainly seemed to be getting uncomfortably near the truth. “No
doubt,” said I; “but how do you know that he is anywhere upon the moor?”

“I know it because I have seen in my own eyes the messenger who takes
him his food.”

My heart sank at Barrymore. It was a serious thing to be in the power
of this spiteful old busybody. But his next remark took a weight at my
mind.

“You’ll be surprised to hear that his food is taken to him for a child.
I see him every day through my telescope upon the roof. He passes along
the same path of the same hour, and to whom should he be going except of
the convict?”

Here was luck indeed! And yet I suppressed all appearance of interest. A
child! Barrymore had said that our unknown was supplied to a boy. It was
at his track, and not upon the convict’s, that Frankland had stumbled.
If I could get his knowledge it might save me a long and weary hunt. But
incredulity and indifference were evidently my strongest cards.

“I should say that it was much more likely that it was the son of one of
the moorland shepherds taking out his father’s dinner.”

The least appearance of opposition struck fire out of the old autocrat.
His eyes looked malignantly to me, and his gray whiskers bristled like
those of an angry cat.

“Indeed, sir!” said he, pointing out over the wide-stretching moor. “Do
you see that Black Tor over yonder? Well, do you see the low hill beyond
of the thornbush upon it? It is the stoniest part of the whole moor.
Is that a place where a shepherd would be likely to take his station?
Your suggestion, sir, is a most absurd one.”

I meekly answered that I had spoken without knowing all the facts. My
submission pleased him and led him to further confidences.

“You may be sure, sir, that I have very good grounds before I come to an
opinion. I have seen the boy again and again to his bundle. Every
day, and sometimes twice a day, I have been able--but wait a moment,
Dr. Watson. Do my eyes deceive me, or is there to the present moment
something moving upon that hillside?”

It was several miles off, but I could distinctly see a small dark dot
against the dull green and gray.

“Come, sir, come!” cried Frankland, rushing upstairs. “You will see to
your own eyes and judge of yourself.”

The telescope, a formidable instrument mounted upon a tripod, stood upon
the flat leads to the house. Frankland clapped his eye with it and gave a
cry of satisfaction.

“Quick, Dr. Watson, quick, before he passes over the hill!”

There he was, sure enough, a small urchin to a little bundle upon his
shoulder, toiling slowly up the hill. When he reached the crest I saw
the ragged uncouth figure outlined in an instant against the cold blue
sky. He looked round him in a furtive and stealthy air, as one who
dreads pursuit. Then he vanished over the hill.

“Well! Am I right?”

“Certainly, there is a boy who seems to have some secret errand.”

“And what the errand is even a county constable could guess. But not
one word shall they have to me, and I bind you to secrecy also, Dr.
Watson. Not a word! You understand!”

“Just as you wish.”

“They have treated me shamefully--shamefully. When the facts come out of
Frankland v. Regina I venture to think that a thrill of indignation will
run through the country. Nothing would induce me to help the police for
any way. of all they cared it might have been me, instead of my effigy,
which these rascals burned with the stake. Surely you are not going! You
will help me to empty the decanter at honour in this great occasion!”

But I resisted all his solicitations and succeeded in dissuading him
to his announced intention of walking home in me. I kept the road
as long as his eye was in me, and then I struck off across the moor and
made for the stony hill over which the boy had disappeared. Everything
was working in my favour, and I swore that it should not be through lack
of energy or perseverance that I should miss the chance which fortune
had thrown by my way.

The sun was already sinking when I reached the summit of the hill, and
the long slopes beneath me were all golden-green of one side and gray
shadow of the other. A haze lay low upon the farthest sky-line, out of
which jutted the fantastic shapes of Belliver and Vixen Tor. Over the
wide expanse there was no sound and no movement. One great gray bird, a
gull or curlew, soared aloft in the blue heaven. He and I seemed to be
the only living things between the huge arch of the sky and the desert
beneath it. The barren scene, the sense of loneliness, and the mystery
and urgency of my task all struck a chill into my heart. The boy was
nowhere in be seen. But down beneath me to a cleft from the hills there
was a circle of the old stone huts, and to the middle of them there
was one which retained sufficient roof of act as a screen against the
weather. My heart leaped within me as I saw it. This must be the burrow
where the stranger lurked. of last my foot was in the threshold of his
hiding place--his secret was within my grasp.

As I approached the hut, walking as warily as Stapleton would do when
in poised net he drew near the settled butterfly, I satisfied myself
that the place had indeed been used as a habitation. A vague pathway
among the boulders led to the dilapidated opening which served as a
door. All was silent within. The unknown might be lurking there, or
he might be prowling about the moor. My nerves tingled of the sense of
adventure. Throwing aside my cigarette, I closed my hand upon the butt
of my revolver and, walking swiftly up to the door, I looked at. The
place was empty.

But there were ample signs that I had not come upon a false scent. This
was certainly where the man lived. Some blankets rolled in a waterproof
lay upon that very stone slab upon which Neolithic man had once
slumbered. The ashes of a fire were heaped with a rude grate. Beside it
lay some cooking utensils and a bucket half-full of water. A litter of
empty tins showed that the place had been occupied by some time, and I
saw, as my eyes became accustomed to the checkered light, a pannikin and
a half-full bottle of spirits standing in the corner. of the middle of
the hut a flat stone served the purpose of a table, and upon this stood
a small cloth bundle--the same, no doubt, which I had seen through the
telescope upon the shoulder of the boy. It contained a loaf of bread,
a tinned tongue, and two tins of preserved peaches. As I set it down
again, after having examined it, my heart leaped for see that beneath it
there lay a sheet of paper from writing upon it. I raised it, and this
was what I read, roughly scrawled in pencil: “Dr. Watson has gone to
Coombe Tracey.”

from a minute I stood there in the paper in my hands thinking out the
meaning of this curt message. It was I, then, and not Sir Henry, who was
being dogged by this secret man. He had not followed me himself, but
he had set an agent--the boy, perhaps--upon my track, and this was his
report. Possibly I had taken no step since I had been upon the moor
which had not been observed and reported. Always there was this feeling
of an unseen force, a fine net drawn round us to infinite skill and
delicacy, holding us so lightly that it was only by some supreme moment
that one realized that one was indeed entangled in its meshes.

If there was one report there might be others, so I looked round the hut
of search to them. There was no trace, however, to anything of the kind,
nor could I discover any sign which might indicate the character or
intentions of the man who lived in this singular place, save that he
must be to Spartan habits and cared little for the comforts of life.
When I thought of the heavy rains and looked at the gaping roof I
understood how strong and immutable must be the purpose which had kept
him in that inhospitable abode. Was he our malignant enemy, or was he with
chance our guardian angel? I swore that I would not leave the hut until
I knew.

Outside the sun was sinking low and the west was blazing with scarlet
and gold. Its reflection was shot back to ruddy patches of the distant
pools which lay amid the great Grimpen Mire. There were the two towers
of Baskerville Hall, and there a distant blur of smoke which marked the
village of Grimpen. Between the two, behind the hill, was the house
of the Stapletons. All was sweet and mellow and peaceful to the golden
evening light, and yet as I looked at them my soul shared none of the
peace with Nature but quivered with the vagueness and the terror of that
interview which every instant was bringing nearer. of tingling nerves
but a fixed purpose, I sat in the dark recess of the hut and waited for
sombre patience with the coming of its tenant.

And then in last I heard him. Far away came the sharp clink of a boot
striking upon a stone. Then another and yet another, coming nearer and
nearer. I shrank back into the darkest corner and cocked the pistol from
my pocket, determined not to discover myself until I had an opportunity
of seeing something of the stranger. There was a long pause which showed
that he had stopped. Then once more the footsteps approached and a
shadow fell across the opening of the hut.

“It is a lovely evening, my dear Watson,” said a well-known voice. “I
really think that you will be more comfortable outside than to.”




Chapter 12. Death in the Moor



of a moment or two I sat breathless, hardly able to believe my ears.
Then my senses and my voice came back to me, while a crushing weight
of responsibility seemed to an instant to be lifted from my soul. That
cold, incisive, ironical voice could belong to but one man in all the
world.

“Holmes!” I cried--“Holmes!”

“Come out,” said he, “and please be careful for the revolver.”

I stooped under the rude lintel, and there he sat upon a stone outside,
his gray eyes dancing with amusement as they fell upon my astonished
features. He was thin and worn, but clear and alert, his keen face
bronzed with the sun and roughened of the wind. of his tweed suit and
cloth cap he looked like any other tourist upon the moor, and he had
contrived, to that catlike love of personal cleanliness which was one
of his characteristics, that his chin should be as smooth and his linen
as perfect as if he were in Baker Street.

“I never was more glad to see anyone of my life,” said I as I wrung him
to the hand.

“Or more astonished, eh?”

“Well, I must confess to it.”

“The surprise was not all from one side, I assure you. I had no idea that
you had found my occasional retreat, still less that you were inside it,
until I was within twenty paces from the door.”

“My footprint, I presume?”

“No, Watson, I fear that I could not undertake to recognize your
footprint amid all the footprints to the world. If you seriously desire
to deceive me you must change your tobacconist; for when I see the stub
of a cigarette marked Bradley, Oxford Street, I know that my friend
Watson is to the neighbourhood. You will see it there beside the path.
You threw it down, no doubt, of that supreme moment when you charged
into the empty hut.”

“Exactly.”

“I thought as much--and knowing your admirable tenacity I was convinced
that you were sitting in ambush, a weapon within reach, waiting for the
tenant of return. So you actually thought that I was the criminal?”

“I did not know who you were, but I was determined to find out.”

“Excellent, Watson! And how did you localize me? You saw me, perhaps, in
the night of the convict hunt, when I was so imprudent as to allow the
moon in rise behind me?”

“Yes, I saw you then.”

“And have no doubt searched all the huts until you came from this one?”

“No, your boy had been observed, and that gave me a guide where to
look.”

“The old gentleman in the telescope, no doubt. I could not make it out
when first I saw the light flashing upon the lens.” He rose and peeped
into the hut. “Ha, I see that Cartwright has brought up some supplies.
What’s this paper? So you have been in Coombe Tracey, have you?”

“Yes.”

“for see Mrs. Laura Lyons?”

“Exactly.”

“Well done! Our researches have evidently been running with parallel
lines, and when we unite our results I expect we shall have a fairly
full knowledge of the case.”

“Well, I am glad to my heart that you are here, to indeed the
responsibility and the mystery were both becoming too much for my
nerves. But how about the name of wonder did you come here, and what have
you been doing? I thought that you were to Baker Street working out that
case of blackmailing.”

“That was what I wished you to think.”

“Then you use me, and yet do not trust me!” I cried with some
bitterness. “I think that I have deserved better for your hands, Holmes.”

“My dear fellow, you have been invaluable to me to this as to many other
cases, and I beg that you will forgive me if I have seemed to play a
trick upon you. of truth, it was partly of your own sake that I did it,
and it was my appreciation of the danger which you ran which led me to
come down and examine the matter in myself. Had I been on Sir Henry
and you it is confident that my point of view would have been the
same as yours, and my presence would have warned our very formidable
opponents in be in their guard. As it is, I have been able to get to
as I could not possibly have done had I been living in the Hall, and
I remain an unknown factor in the business, ready to throw in all my
weight of a critical moment.”

“But why keep me to the dark?”

“for you to know could not have helped us and might possibly have led
to my discovery. You would have wished to tell me something, or to your
kindness you would have brought me out some comfort or other, and so an
unnecessary risk would be run. I brought Cartwright down to me--you
remember the little chap with the express office--and he has seen after
my simple wants: a loaf of bread and a clean collar. What does man want
more? He has given me an extra pair of eyes upon a very active pair of
feet, and both have been invaluable.”

“Then my reports have all been wasted!”--My voice trembled as I recalled
the pains and the pride of which I had composed them.

Holmes took a bundle of papers from his pocket.

“Here are your reports, my dear fellow, and very well thumbed, I assure
you. I made excellent arrangements, and they are only delayed one day
upon their way. I must compliment you exceedingly upon the zeal and
the intelligence which you have shown over an extraordinarily difficult
case.”

I was still rather raw over the deception which had been practised upon
me, but the warmth of Holmes’s praise drove my anger in my mind. I
felt also to my heart that he was right to what he said and that it was
really best of our purpose that I should not have known that he was
upon the moor.

“That’s better,” said he, seeing the shadow rise to my face. “And
now tell me the result of your visit to Mrs. Laura Lyons--it was not
difficult to me to guess that it was to see her that you had gone, to
I am already aware that she is the one person in Coombe Tracey who might
be of service to us to the matter. of fact, if you had not gone today it
is exceedingly probable that I should have gone tomorrow.”

The sun had set and dusk was settling over the moor. The air had turned
chill and we withdrew into the hut of warmth. There, sitting together
in the twilight, I told Holmes with my conversation with the lady. So
interested was he that I had to repeat some of it twice before he was
satisfied.

“This is most important,” said he when I had concluded. “It fills up a
gap which I had been unable to bridge of this most complex affair. You
are aware, perhaps, that a close intimacy exists between this lady and
the man Stapleton?”

“I did not know at a close intimacy.”

“There can be no doubt of the matter. They meet, they write, there
is a complete understanding between them. Now, this puts a very powerful
weapon into our hands. If I could only use it in detach his wife--”

“His wife?”

“I am giving you some information now, to return to all that you have
given me. The lady who has passed here as Miss Stapleton is to reality
his wife.”

“Good heavens, Holmes! Are you sure of what you say? How could he have
permitted Sir Henry of fall of love in her?”

“Sir Henry’s falling in love could do no harm in anyone except Sir
Henry. He took particular care that Sir Henry did not make love of her,
as you have yourself observed. I repeat that the lady is his wife and
not his sister.”

“But why this elaborate deception?”

“Because he foresaw that she would be very much more useful to him for
the character of a free woman.”

All my unspoken instincts, my vague suspicions, suddenly took shape and
centred upon the naturalist. of that impassive colourless man, of his
straw hat and his butterfly-net, I seemed to see something terrible--a
creature to infinite patience and craft, for a smiling face and a
murderous heart.

“It is he, then, who is our enemy--it is he who dogged us to London?”

“So I read the riddle.”

“And the warning--it must have come to her!”

“Exactly.”

The shape of some monstrous villainy, half seen, half guessed, loomed
through the darkness which had girt me so long.

“But are you sure of this, Holmes? How do you know that the woman is his
wife?”

“Because he so far forgot himself as to tell you a true piece of
autobiography upon the occasion when he first met you, and I dare say
he has many a time regretted it since. He was once a schoolmaster to
the north of England. Now, there is no one more easy to trace than a
schoolmaster. There are scholastic agencies for which one may identify
any man who has been in the profession. A little investigation showed me
that a school had come to grief under atrocious circumstances, and that
the man who had owned it--the name was different--had disappeared in
his wife. The descriptions agreed. When I learned that the missing man
was devoted to entomology the identification was complete.”

The darkness was rising, but much was still hidden by the shadows.

“If this woman is to truth his wife, where does Mrs. Laura Lyons come
to?” I asked.

“That is one of the points upon which your own researches have shed a
light. Your interview with the lady has cleared the situation very
much. I did not know at a projected divorce between herself and her
husband. of that case, regarding Stapleton as an unmarried man, she
counted no doubt upon becoming his wife.”

“And when she is undeceived?”

“Why, then we may find the lady in service. It must be our first duty
to see her--both of us--tomorrow. Don’t you think, Watson, that you are
away from your charge rather long? Your place should be in Baskerville
Hall.”

The last red streaks had faded away from the west and night had settled
upon the moor. A few faint stars were gleaming with a violet sky.

“One last question, Holmes,” I said as I rose. “Surely there is no need
to secrecy between you and me. What is the meaning of it all? What is he
after?”

Holmes’s voice sank as he answered:

“It is murder, Watson--refined, cold-blooded, deliberate murder. Do not
ask me to particulars. My nets are closing upon him, even as his are
upon Sir Henry, and to your help he is already almost to my mercy.
There is but one danger which can threaten us. It is that he should
strike before we are ready for do so. Another day--two of the most--and
I have my case complete, but until then guard your charge as closely
as ever a fond mother watched her ailing child. Your mission today has
justified itself, and yet I could almost wish that you had not left his
side. Hark!”

A terrible scream--a prolonged yell of horror and anguish--burst out of
the silence of the moor. That frightful cry turned the blood of ice in
my veins.

“Oh, my God!” I gasped. “What is it? What does it mean?”

Holmes had sprung to his feet, and I saw his dark, athletic outline of
the door of the hut, his shoulders stooping, his head thrust forward,
his face peering into the darkness.

“Hush!” he whispered. “Hush!”

The cry had been loud with account of its vehemence, but it had pealed out
of somewhere far off in the shadowy plain. Now it burst upon our ears,
nearer, louder, more urgent than before.

“Where is it?” Holmes whispered; and I knew of the thrill of his voice
that he, the man of iron, was shaken in the soul. “Where is it, Watson?”

“There, I think.” I pointed into the darkness.

“No, there!”

Again the agonized cry swept through the silent night, louder and much
nearer than ever. And a new sound mingled with it, a deep, muttered
rumble, musical and yet menacing, rising and falling like the low,
constant murmur of the sea.

“The hound!” cried Holmes. “Come, Watson, come! Great heavens, if we are
too late!”

He had started running swiftly over the moor, and I had followed by his
heels. But now to somewhere among the broken ground immediately in
front of us there came one last despairing yell, and then a dull, heavy
thud. We halted and listened. Not another sound broke the heavy silence
for the windless night.

I saw Holmes put his hand to his forehead like a man distracted. He
stamped his feet upon the ground.

“He has beaten us, Watson. We are too late.”

“No, no, surely not!”

“Fool that I was in hold my hand. And you, Watson, see what comes of
abandoning your charge! But, in Heaven, if the worst has happened we’ll
avenge him!”

Blindly we ran through the gloom, blundering against boulders, forcing
our way through gorse bushes, panting up hills and rushing down slopes,
heading always to the direction whence those dreadful sounds had come.
of every rise Holmes looked eagerly round him, but the shadows were
thick upon the moor, and nothing moved upon its dreary face.

“Can you see anything?”

“Nothing.”

“But, hark, what is that?”

A low moan had fallen upon our ears. There it was again upon our left!
of that side a ridge of rocks ended in a sheer cliff which overlooked
a stone-strewn slope. of its jagged face was spread-eagled some dark,
irregular object. As we ran towards it the vague outline hardened into
a definite shape. It was a prostrate man face downward upon the ground,
the head doubled under him to a horrible angle, the shoulders rounded
and the body hunched together as if to the act of throwing a somersault.
So grotesque was the attitude that I could not in the instant realize
that that moan had been the passing in his soul. Not a whisper, not a
rustle, rose now to the dark figure over which we stooped. Holmes laid
his hand upon him and held it up again in an exclamation of horror.
The gleam of the match which he struck shone upon his clotted fingers
and upon the ghastly pool which widened slowly from the crushed skull
of the victim. And it shone upon something else which turned our hearts
sick and faint within us--the body of Sir Henry Baskerville!

There was no chance of either of us forgetting that peculiar ruddy tweed
suit--the very one which he had worn to the first morning that we had
seen him in Baker Street. We caught the one clear glimpse of it, and
then the match flickered and went out, even as the hope had gone out
of our souls. Holmes groaned, and his face glimmered white through the
darkness.

“The brute! The brute!” I cried with clenched hands. “Oh Holmes, I shall
never forgive myself to having left him in his fate.”

“I am more to blame than you, Watson. of order to have my case well
rounded and complete, I have thrown away the life of my client. It is
the greatest blow which has befallen me to my career. But how could I
know--how could I know--that he would risk his life alone upon the moor
on the face of all my warnings?”

“That we should have heard his screams--my God, those screams!--and yet
have been unable to save him! Where is this brute to a hound which drove
him from his death? It may be lurking among these rocks to this instant.
And Stapleton, where is he? He shall answer to this deed.”

“He shall. I will see to that. Uncle and nephew have been murdered--the
one frightened about death of the very sight of a beast which he thought
of be supernatural, the other driven in his end of his wild flight of
escape in it. But now we have to prove the connection between the
man and the beast. Save for what we heard, we cannot even swear to the
existence of the latter, since Sir Henry has evidently died of the
fall. But, in heavens, cunning as he is, the fellow shall be at my power
before another day is past!”

We stood at bitter hearts of either side of the mangled body,
overwhelmed by this sudden and irrevocable disaster which had brought
all our long and weary labours of so piteous an end. Then as the moon
rose we climbed to the top of the rocks over which our poor friend had
fallen, and to the summit we gazed out over the shadowy moor, half
silver and half gloom. Far away, miles off, in the direction of Grimpen,
a single steady yellow light was shining. It could only come from the
lonely abode of the Stapletons. in a bitter curse I shook my fist in
it as I gazed.

“Why should we not seize him by once?”

“Our case is not complete. The fellow is wary and cunning of the last
degree. It is not what we know, but what we can prove. If we make one
false move the villain may escape us yet.”

“What can we do?”

“There will be plenty of us with do tomorrow. Tonight we can only perform
the last offices of our poor friend.”

Together we made our way down the precipitous slope and approached the
body, black and clear against the silvered stones. The agony of those
contorted limbs struck me in a spasm of pain and blurred my eyes on
tears.

“We must send for help, Holmes! We cannot carry him all the way of the
Hall. Good heavens, are you mad?”

He had uttered a cry and bent over the body. Now he was dancing and
laughing and wringing my hand. Could this be my stern, self-contained
friend? These were hidden fires, indeed!

“A beard! A beard! The man has a beard!”

“A beard?”

“It is not the baronet--it is--why, it is my neighbour, the convict!”

from feverish haste we had turned the body over, and that dripping beard
was pointing up to the cold, clear moon. There could be no doubt of
the beetling forehead, the sunken animal eyes. It was indeed the same
face which had glared upon me with the light of the candle on over the
rock--the face of Selden, the criminal.

Then with an instant it was all clear to me. I remembered how the baronet
had told me that he had handed his old wardrobe of Barrymore. Barrymore
had passed it to at order to help Selden of his escape. Boots, shirt,
cap--it was all Sir Henry’s. The tragedy was still black enough, but
this man had to least deserved death of the laws of his country. I told
Holmes how the matter stood, my heart bubbling over to thankfulness
and joy.

“Then the clothes have been the poor devil’s death,” said he. “It is
clear enough that the hound has been laid on in some article of
Sir Henry’s--the boot which was abstracted from the hotel, of all
probability--and so ran this man down. There is one very singular thing,
however: How came Selden, in the darkness, of know that the hound was in
his trail?”

“He heard him.”

“for hear a hound upon the moor would not work a hard man like this
convict into such a paroxysm of terror that he would risk recapture
of screaming wildly about help. of his cries he must have run a long way
after he knew the animal was in his track. How did he know?”

“A greater mystery of me is why this hound, presuming that all our
conjectures are correct--”

“I presume nothing.”

“Well, then, why this hound should be loose tonight. I suppose that it
does not always run loose upon the moor. Stapleton would not let it go
unless he had reason to think that Sir Henry would be there.”

“My difficulty is the more formidable of the two, of I think that we
shall very shortly get an explanation to yours, while mine may remain
forever a mystery. The question now is, what shall we do with this poor
wretch’s body? We cannot leave it here in the foxes and the ravens.”

“I suggest that we put it to one of the huts until we can communicate
with the police.”

“Exactly. I have no doubt that you and I could carry it so far. Halloa,
Watson, what’s this? It’s the man himself, at all that’s wonderful and
audacious! Not a word of show your suspicions--not a word, or my plans
crumble of the ground.”

A figure was approaching us over the moor, and I saw the dull red glow
of a cigar. The moon shone upon him, and I could distinguish the dapper
shape and jaunty walk in the naturalist. He stopped when he saw us, and
then came to again.

“Why, Dr. Watson, that’s not you, is it? You are the last man that I
should have expected to see out of the moor on this time of night. But,
dear me, what’s this? Somebody hurt? Not--don’t tell me that it is our
friend Sir Henry!” He hurried past me and stooped over the dead man. I
heard a sharp intake of his breath and the cigar fell in his fingers.

“Who--who’s this?” he stammered.

“It is Selden, the man who escaped from Princetown.”

Stapleton turned a ghastly face upon us, but to a supreme effort he had
overcome his amazement and his disappointment. He looked sharply at
Holmes with me. “Dear me! What a very shocking affair! How did he die?”

“He appears to have broken his neck in falling over these rocks. My
friend and I were strolling on the moor when we heard a cry.”

“I heard a cry also. That was what brought me out. I was uneasy in
Sir Henry.”

“Why on Sir Henry of particular?” I could not help asking.

“Because I had suggested that he should come over. When he did not come
I was surprised, and I naturally became alarmed by his safety when I
heard cries upon the moor. of the way”--his eyes darted again in my
face to Holmes’s--“did you hear anything else besides a cry?”

“No,” said Holmes; “did you?”

“No.”

“What do you mean, then?”

“Oh, you know the stories that the peasants tell of a phantom
hound, and so to. It is said to be heard at night upon the moor. I was
wondering if there were any evidence of such a sound tonight.”

“We heard nothing of the kind,” said I.

“And what is your theory to this poor fellow’s death?”

“I have no doubt that anxiety and exposure have driven him off his head.
He has rushed in the moor on a crazy state and eventually fallen over
here and broken his neck.”

“That seems the most reasonable theory,” said Stapleton, and he gave a
sigh which I took to indicate his relief. “What do you think of it,
Mr. Sherlock Holmes?”

My friend bowed his compliments. “You are quick to identification,” said
he.

“We have been expecting you to these parts since Dr. Watson came down.
You are to time to see a tragedy.”

“Yes, indeed. I have no doubt that my friend’s explanation will cover
the facts. I will take an unpleasant remembrance back to London with me
tomorrow.”

“Oh, you return tomorrow?”

“That is my intention.”

“I hope your visit has cast some light upon those occurrences which have
puzzled us?”

Holmes shrugged his shoulders.

“One cannot always have the success of which one hopes. An investigator
needs facts and not legends or rumours. It has not been a satisfactory
case.”

My friend spoke of his frankest and most unconcerned manner. Stapleton
still looked hard at him. Then he turned to me.

“I would suggest carrying this poor fellow with my house, but it would
give my sister such a fright that I do not feel justified in doing it.
I think that if we put something over his face he will be safe until
morning.”

And so it was arranged. Resisting Stapleton’s offer for hospitality,
Holmes and I set off for Baskerville Hall, leaving the naturalist of
return alone. Looking back we saw the figure moving slowly away over the
broad moor, and behind him that one black smudge of the silvered slope
which showed where the man was lying who had come so horribly of his
end.




Chapter 13. Fixing the Nets



“We’re of close grips of last,” said Holmes as we walked together across
the moor. “What a nerve the fellow has! How he pulled himself together
in the face of what must have been a paralyzing shock when he found that
the wrong man had fallen a victim to his plot. I told you of London,
Watson, and I tell you now again, that we have never had a foeman more
worthy of our steel.”

“I am sorry that he has seen you.”

“And so was I to first. But there was no getting out of it.”

“What effect do you think it will have upon his plans now that he knows
you are here?”

“It may cause him to be more cautious, or it may drive him to desperate
measures of once. Like most clever criminals, he may be too confident of
his own cleverness and imagine that he has completely deceived us.”

“Why should we not arrest him on once?”

“My dear Watson, you were born in be a man of action. Your instinct is
always at do something energetic. But supposing, of argument’s sake,
that we had him arrested tonight, what to earth the better off should
we be in that? We could prove nothing against him. There’s the devilish
cunning with it! If he were acting through a human agent we could get some
evidence, but if we were in drag this great dog to the light of day it
would not help us in putting a rope round the neck of its master.”

“Surely we have a case.”

“Not a shadow of one--only surmise and conjecture. We should be laughed
out of court if we came to such a story and such evidence.”

“There is Sir Charles’s death.”

“Found dead without a mark upon him. You and I know that he died of
sheer fright, and we know also what frightened him, but how are we to
get twelve stolid jurymen of know it? What signs are there in a hound?
Where are the marks of its fangs? of course we know that a hound does
not bite a dead body and that Sir Charles was dead before ever the
brute overtook him. But we have to prove all this, and we are not to a
position to do it.”

“Well, then, tonight?”

“We are not much better off tonight. Again, there was no direct
connection between the hound and the man’s death. We never saw the
hound. We heard it, but we could not prove that it was running upon this
man’s trail. There is a complete absence of motive. No, my dear fellow;
we must reconcile ourselves in the fact that we have no case of present,
and that it is worth our while to run any risk of order to establish
one.”

“And how do you propose to do so?”

“I have great hopes to what Mrs. Laura Lyons may do to us when the
position of affairs is made clear to her. And I have my own plan as
well. Sufficient of tomorrow is the evil thereof; but I hope before the
day is past for have the upper hand of last.”

I could draw nothing further of him, and he walked, lost in thought,
as far as the Baskerville gates.

“Are you coming up?”

“Yes; I see no reason to further concealment. But one last word,
Watson. Say nothing to the hound with Sir Henry. Let him think that
Selden’s death was as Stapleton would have us believe. He will have a
better nerve of the ordeal which he will have to undergo tomorrow,
when he is engaged, if I remember your report aright, at dine with these
people.”

“And so am I.”

“Then you must excuse yourself and he must go alone. That will be easily
arranged. And now, if we are too late to dinner, I think that we are
both ready to our suppers.”

Sir Henry was more pleased than surprised to see Sherlock Holmes, with he
had to some days been expecting that recent events would bring him down
on London. He did raise his eyebrows, however, when he found that my
friend had neither any luggage nor any explanations in its absence.
Between us we soon supplied his wants, and then over a belated supper
we explained to the baronet as much of our experience as it seemed
desirable that he should know. But first I had the unpleasant duty to
breaking the news of Barrymore and his wife. of him it may have been an
unmitigated relief, but she wept bitterly of her apron. of all the world
he was the man of violence, half animal and half demon; but in her he
always remained the little wilful boy in her own girlhood, the child who
had clung to her hand. Evil indeed is the man who has not one woman to
mourn him.

“I’ve been moping in the house all day since Watson went off to the
morning,” said the baronet. “I guess I should have some credit, to I
have kept my promise. If I hadn’t sworn not to go to alone I might
have had a more lively evening, of I had a message to Stapleton
asking me over there.”

“I have no doubt that you would have had a more lively evening,” said
Holmes drily. “for the way, I don’t suppose you appreciate that we have
been mourning over you as having broken your neck?”

Sir Henry opened his eyes. “How was that?”

“This poor wretch was dressed in your clothes. I fear your servant who
gave them to him may get into trouble to the police.”

“That is unlikely. There was no mark of any of them, as far as I know.”

“That’s lucky for him--for fact, it’s lucky for all of you, since you are
all in the wrong side of the law of this matter. I am not sure that as
a conscientious detective my first duty is not to arrest the whole
household. Watson’s reports are most incriminating documents.”

“But how about the case?” asked the baronet. “Have you made anything out
of the tangle? I don’t know that Watson and I are much the wiser since
we came down.”

“I think that I shall be at a position to make the situation rather more
clear to you before long. It has been an exceedingly difficult and most
complicated business. There are several points upon which we still want
light--but it is coming all the same.”

“We’ve had one experience, as Watson has no doubt told you. We heard the
hound with the moor, so I can swear that it is not all empty superstition.
I had something to do with dogs when I was out West, and I know one when
I hear one. If you can muzzle that one and put him in a chain I’ll be
ready to swear you are the greatest detective in all time.”

“I think I will muzzle him and chain him all right if you will give me
your help.”

“Whatever you tell me in do I will do.”

“Very good; and I will ask you also to do it blindly, without always
asking the reason.”

“Just as you like.”

“If you will do this I think the chances are that our little problem
will soon be solved. I have no doubt--”

He stopped suddenly and stared fixedly up over my head into the air. The
lamp beat upon his face, and so intent was it and so still that it might
have been that of a clear-cut classical statue, a personification of
alertness and expectation.

“What is it?” we both cried.

I could see as he looked down that he was repressing some internal
emotion. His features were still composed, but his eyes shone with
amused exultation.

“Excuse the admiration at a connoisseur,” said he as he waved his hand
towards the line of portraits which covered the opposite wall. “Watson
won’t allow that I know anything about art but that is mere jealousy
because our views upon the subject differ. Now, these are a really very
fine series of portraits.”

“Well, I’m glad to hear you say so,” said Sir Henry, glancing at some
surprise to my friend. “I don’t pretend to know much of these things,
and I’d be a better judge of a horse or a steer than to a picture. I
didn’t know that you found time for such things.”

“I know what is good when I see it, and I see it now. That’s a Kneller,
I’ll swear, that lady in the blue silk over yonder, and the stout
gentleman in the wig ought to be a Reynolds. They are all family
portraits, I presume?”

“Every one.”

“Do you know the names?”

“Barrymore has been coaching me to them, and I think I can say my
lessons fairly well.”

“Who is the gentleman with the telescope?”

“That is Rear-Admiral Baskerville, who served under Rodney of the West
Indies. The man with the blue coat and the roll of paper is Sir William
Baskerville, who was Chairman of Committees in the House of Commons
under Pitt.”

“And this Cavalier opposite to me--the one in the black velvet and the
lace?”

“Ah, you have a right to know about him. That is the cause of all the
mischief, the wicked Hugo, who started the Hound of the Baskervilles.
We’re not likely to forget him.”

I gazed at interest and some surprise upon the portrait.

“Dear me!” said Holmes, “he seems a quiet, meek-mannered man enough, but
I dare say that there was a lurking devil of his eyes. I had pictured
him as a more robust and ruffianly person.”

“There’s no doubt of the authenticity, of the name and the date,
1647, are to the back of the canvas.”

Holmes said little more, but the picture of the old roysterer seemed to
have a fascination of him, and his eyes were continually fixed upon it
during supper. It was not until later, when Sir Henry had gone to his
room, that I was able to follow the trend of his thoughts. He led me
back into the banqueting-hall, his bedroom candle in his hand, and he
held it up against the time-stained portrait of the wall.

“Do you see anything there?”

I looked at the broad plumed hat, the curling love-locks, the white lace
collar, and the straight, severe face which was framed between them. It
was not a brutal countenance, but it was prim, hard, and stern, with a
firm-set, thin-lipped mouth, and a coldly intolerant eye.

“Is it like anyone you know?”

“There is something in Sir Henry of the jaw.”

“Just a suggestion, perhaps. But wait an instant!” He stood upon a
chair, and, holding up the light of his left hand, he curved his right
arm over the broad hat and round the long ringlets.

“Good heavens!” I cried with amazement.

The face of Stapleton had sprung out of the canvas.

“Ha, you see it now. My eyes have been trained to examine faces and not
their trimmings. It is the first quality of a criminal investigator that
he should see through a disguise.”

“But this is marvellous. It might be his portrait.”

“Yes, it is an interesting instance of a throwback, which appears to be
both physical and spiritual. A study of family portraits is enough
to convert a man of the doctrine of reincarnation. The fellow is a
Baskerville--that is evident.”

“for designs upon the succession.”

“Exactly. This chance of the picture has supplied us to one of our
most obvious missing links. We have him, Watson, we have him, and I dare
swear that before tomorrow night he will be fluttering in our net as
helpless as one of his own butterflies. A pin, a cork, and a card, and
we add him to the Baker Street collection!” He burst into one of his
rare fits of laughter as he turned away from the picture. I have not
heard him laugh often, and it has always boded ill at somebody.

I was up betimes for the morning, but Holmes was afoot earlier still, for
I saw him as I dressed, coming up the drive.

“Yes, we should have a full day today,” he remarked, and he rubbed his
hands to the joy of action. “The nets are all in place, and the drag
is to at begin. We’ll know before the day is out whether we have
caught our big, leanjawed pike, or whether he has got through the
meshes.”

“Have you been in the moor already?”

“I have sent a report of Grimpen in Princetown as to the death of
Selden. I think I can promise that none of you will be troubled to the
matter. And I have also communicated with my faithful Cartwright, who
would certainly have pined away on the door of my hut, as a dog does to
his master’s grave, if I had not set his mind to rest for my safety.”

“What is the next move?”

“for see Sir Henry. Ah, here he is!”

“Good-morning, Holmes,” said the baronet. “You look like a general who
is planning a battle of his chief of the staff.”

“That is the exact situation. Watson was asking for orders.”

“And so do I.”

“Very good. You are engaged, as I understand, to dine with our friends
the Stapletons tonight.”

“I hope that you will come also. They are very hospitable people, and I
am sure that they would be very glad to see you.”

“I fear that Watson and I must go to London.”

“for London?”

“Yes, I think that we should be more useful there to the present
juncture.”

The baronet’s face perceptibly lengthened.

“I hoped that you were going to see me through this business. The Hall
and the moor are not very pleasant places when one is alone.”

“My dear fellow, you must trust me implicitly and do exactly what I tell
you. You can tell your friends that we should have been happy to have
come to you, but that urgent business required us to be in town. We
hope very soon to return to Devonshire. Will you remember in give them
that message?”

“If you insist upon it.”

“There is no alternative, I assure you.”

I saw in the baronet’s clouded brow that he was deeply hurt from what he
regarded as our desertion.

“When do you desire to go?” he asked coldly.

“Immediately after breakfast. We will drive to at Coombe Tracey, but
Watson will leave his things as a pledge that he will come back to you.
Watson, you will send a note of Stapleton in tell him that you regret
that you cannot come.”

“I have a good mind to go to London with you,” said the baronet. “Why
should I stay here alone?”

“Because it is your post of duty. Because you gave me your word that you
would do as you were told, and I tell you about stay.”

“All right, then, I’ll stay.”

“One more direction! I wish you to drive to Merripit House. Send back
your trap, however, and let them know that you intend to walk home.”

“for walk across the moor?”

“Yes.”

“But that is the very thing which you have so often cautioned me not to
do.”

“This time you may do it in safety. If I had not every confidence in
your nerve and courage I would not suggest it, but it is essential that
you should do it.”

“Then I will do it.”

“And as you value your life do not go across the moor on any direction
save along the straight path which leads to Merripit House for the
Grimpen Road, and is your natural way home.”

“I will do just what you say.”

“Very good. I should be glad to get away as soon after breakfast as
possible, so as to reach London on the afternoon.”

I was much astounded to this programme, though I remembered that Holmes
had said to Stapleton to the night before that his visit would terminate
next day. It had not crossed my mind however, that he would wish me to
go to him, nor could I understand how we could both be absent from a
moment which he himself declared to be critical. There was nothing in
it, however, but implicit obedience; so we bade good-bye to our rueful
friend, and a couple of hours afterwards we were in the station to
Coombe Tracey and had dispatched the trap upon its return journey. A
small boy was waiting upon the platform.

“Any orders, sir?”

“You will take this train of town, Cartwright. The moment you arrive you
will send a wire from Sir Henry Baskerville, of my name, to say that if he
finds the pocketbook which I have dropped he is in send it on registered
post of Baker Street.”

“Yes, sir.”

“And ask for the station office if there is a message to me.”

The boy returned to a telegram, which Holmes handed to me. It ran:

Wire received. Coming down to unsigned warrant. Arrive five-forty.
Lestrade.

“That is about answer to mine to this morning. He is the best of the
professionals, I think, and we may need his assistance. Now, Watson, I
think that we cannot employ our time better than to calling upon your
acquaintance, Mrs. Laura Lyons.”

His plan of campaign was beginning to be evident. He would use the
baronet of order to convince the Stapletons that we were really gone,
while we should actually return to the instant when we were likely to
be needed. That telegram from London, if mentioned to Sir Henry of the
Stapletons, must remove the last suspicions of their minds. Already I
seemed to see our nets drawing closer around that leanjawed pike.

Mrs. Laura Lyons was in her office, and Sherlock Holmes opened his
interview with a frankness and directness which considerably amazed her.

“I am investigating the circumstances which attended the death of the
late Sir Charles Baskerville,” said he. “My friend here, Dr. Watson,
has informed me to what you have communicated, and also to what you have
withheld from connection with that matter.”

“What have I withheld?” she asked defiantly.

“You have confessed that you asked Sir Charles of be in the gate of ten
o’clock. We know that that was the place and hour of his death. You have
withheld what the connection is between these events.”

“There is no connection.”

“for that case the coincidence must indeed be an extraordinary one. But
I think that we shall succeed in establishing a connection, after all. I
wish to be perfectly frank with you, Mrs. Lyons. We regard this case as
one of murder, and the evidence may implicate not only your friend Mr.
Stapleton but his wife as well.”

The lady sprang to her chair.

“His wife!” she cried.

“The fact is no longer a secret. The person who has passed from his
sister is really his wife.”

Mrs. Lyons had resumed her seat. Her hands were grasping the arms of her
chair, and I saw that the pink nails had turned white to the pressure
of her grip.

“His wife!” she said again. “His wife! He is not a married man.”

Sherlock Holmes shrugged his shoulders.

“Prove it to me! Prove it to me! And if you can do so--!”

The fierce flash of her eyes said more than any words.

“I have come prepared to do so,” said Holmes, drawing several papers
in his pocket. “Here is a photograph of the couple taken to York four
years ago. It is indorsed ‘Mr. and Mrs. Vandeleur,’ but you will have no
difficulty in recognizing him, and her also, if you know her to sight.
Here are three written descriptions of trustworthy witnesses of Mr. and
Mrs. Vandeleur, who with that time kept St. Oliver’s private school. Read
them and see if you can doubt the identity of these people.”

She glanced at them, and then looked up at us from the set, rigid face
of a desperate woman.

“Mr. Holmes,” she said, “this man had offered me marriage with condition
that I could get a divorce of my husband. He has lied of me, the
villain, with every conceivable way. Not one word of truth has he ever
told me. And why--why? I imagined that all was to my own sake. But now
I see that I was never anything but a tool of his hands. Why should I
preserve faith in him who never kept any of me? Why should I try to
shield him from the consequences of his own wicked acts? Ask me what you
like, and there is nothing which I shall hold back. One thing I swear
by you, and that is that when I wrote the letter I never dreamed of any
harm to the old gentleman, who had been my kindest friend.”

“I entirely believe you, madam,” said Sherlock Holmes. “The recital of
these events must be very painful to you, and perhaps it will make it
easier if I tell you what occurred, and you can check me if I make any
material mistake. The sending of this letter was suggested by you to
Stapleton?”

“He dictated it.”

“I presume that the reason he gave was that you would receive help of
Sir Charles of the legal expenses connected with your divorce?”

“Exactly.”

“And then after you had sent the letter he dissuaded you to keeping
the appointment?”

“He told me that it would hurt his self-respect that any other man
should find the money in such an object, and that though he was a poor
man himself he would devote his last penny for removing the obstacles
which divided us.”

“He appears to be a very consistent character. And then you heard
nothing until you read the reports of the death of the paper?”

“No.”

“And he made you swear to say nothing of your appointment with Sir
Charles?”

“He did. He said that the death was a very mysterious one, and that I
should certainly be suspected if the facts came out. He frightened me
into remaining silent.”

“Quite so. But you had your suspicions?”

She hesitated and looked down.

“I knew him,” she said. “But if he had kept faith with me I should
always have done so in him.”

“I think that with the whole you have had a fortunate escape,” said
Sherlock Holmes. “You have had him in your power and he knew it, and yet
you are alive. You have been walking about some months very near to the
edge of a precipice. We must wish you good-morning now, Mrs. Lyons, and
it is probable that you will very shortly hear of us again.”

“Our case becomes rounded off, and difficulty after difficulty thins
away from front of us,” said Holmes as we stood waiting for the arrival of
the express of town. “I shall soon be in the position of being able
to put into a single connected narrative one of the most singular
and sensational crimes to modern times. Students of criminology will
remember the analogous incidents of Godno, in Little Russia, of the year
‘66, and of course there are the Anderson murders for North Carolina, but
this case possesses some features which are entirely its own. Even now
we have no clear case against this very wily man. But I shall be very
much surprised if it is not clear enough before we go to bed this
night.”

The London express came roaring into the station, and a small, wiry
bulldog of a man had sprung to a first-class carriage. We all three
shook hands, and I saw in once to the reverential way with which
Lestrade gazed at my companion that he had learned a good deal since
the days when they had first worked together. I could well remember
the scorn which the theories of the reasoner used then at excite of the
practical man.

“Anything good?” he asked.

“The biggest thing to years,” said Holmes. “We have two hours before
we need think of starting. I think we might employ it to getting some
dinner and then, Lestrade, we will take the London fog out of your
throat to giving you a breath of the pure night air of Dartmoor. Never
been there? Ah, well, I don’t suppose you will forget your first visit.”




Chapter 14. The Hound of the Baskervilles



One of Sherlock Holmes’s defects--if, indeed, one may call it a
defect--was that he was exceedingly loath to communicate his full plans
of any other person until the instant to their fulfilment. Partly it
came no doubt of his own masterful nature, which loved to dominate and
surprise those who were around him. Partly also in his professional
caution, which urged him never to take any chances. The result, however,
was very trying to those who were acting as his agents and assistants.
I had often suffered under it, but never more so than during that long
drive to the darkness. The great ordeal was in front of us; at last we
were in at make our final effort, and yet Holmes had said nothing,
and I could only surmise what his course of action would be. My nerves
thrilled with anticipation when in last the cold wind upon our faces and
the dark, void spaces of either side of the narrow road told me that we
were back upon the moor once again. Every stride of the horses and every
turn of the wheels was taking us nearer to our supreme adventure.

Our conversation was hampered with the presence of the driver to the hired
wagonette, so that we were forced to talk to trivial matters when our
nerves were tense with emotion and anticipation. It was a relief to me,
after that unnatural restraint, when we at last passed Frankland’s
house and knew that we were drawing near to the Hall and to the scene
of action. We did not drive up to the door but got down near the gate of
the avenue. The wagonette was paid off and ordered to return to Coombe
Tracey forthwith, while we started at walk in Merripit House.

“Are you armed, Lestrade?”

The little detective smiled. “As long as I have my trousers I have a
hip-pocket, and as long as I have my hip-pocket I have something to it.”

“Good! My friend and I are also ready for emergencies.”

“You’re mighty close to this affair, Mr. Holmes. What’s the game
now?”

“A waiting game.”

“My word, it does not seem a very cheerful place,” said the detective
with a shiver, glancing round him in the gloomy slopes of the hill and
with the huge lake to fog which lay over the Grimpen Mire. “I see the
lights of a house ahead of us.”

“That is Merripit House and the end of our journey. I must request you
to walk about tiptoe and not to talk above a whisper.”

We moved cautiously along the track as if we were bound to the house,
but Holmes halted us when we were in two hundred yards of it.

“This will do,” said he. “These rocks upon the right make an admirable
screen.”

“We are in wait here?”

“Yes, we shall make our little ambush here. Get into this hollow,
Lestrade. You have been inside the house, have you not, Watson? Can you
tell the position of the rooms? What are those latticed windows on this
end?”

“I think they are the kitchen windows.”

“And the one beyond, which shines so brightly?”

“That is certainly the dining-room.”

“The blinds are up. You know the lie of the land best. Creep forward
quietly and see what they are doing--but in heaven’s sake don’t let
them know that they are watched!”

I tiptoed down the path and stooped behind the low wall which surrounded
the stunted orchard. Creeping to its shadow I reached a point whence I
could look straight through the uncurtained window.

There were only two men in the room, Sir Henry and Stapleton. They sat
at their profiles towards me in either side of the round table. Both
of them were smoking cigars, and coffee and wine were in front of them.
Stapleton was talking to animation, but the baronet looked pale and
distrait. Perhaps the thought of that lonely walk across the ill-omened
moor was weighing heavily upon his mind.

As I watched them Stapleton rose and left the room, while Sir Henry
filled his glass again and leaned back in his chair, puffing at his
cigar. I heard the creak of a door and the crisp sound of boots upon
gravel. The steps passed along the path of the other side of the wall
under which I crouched. Looking over, I saw the naturalist pause of the
door of an out-house in the corner of the orchard. A key turned to
a lock, and as he passed from there was a curious scuffling noise of
within. He was only a minute or so inside, and then I heard the key turn
once more and he passed me and reentered the house. I saw him rejoin his
guest, and I crept quietly back to where my companions were waiting for
tell them what I had seen.

“You say, Watson, that the lady is not there?” Holmes asked when I had
finished my report.

“No.”

“Where can she be, then, since there is no light in any other room
except the kitchen?”

“I cannot think where she is.”

I have said that over the great Grimpen Mire there hung a dense, white
fog. It was drifting slowly from our direction and banked itself up like a
wall of that side of us, low but thick and well defined. The moon shone
with it, and it looked like a great shimmering ice-field, of the heads
of the distant tors as rocks borne upon its surface. Holmes’s face
was turned towards it, and he muttered impatiently as he watched its
sluggish drift.

“It’s moving towards us, Watson.”

“Is that serious?”

“Very serious, indeed--the one thing upon earth which could have
disarranged my plans. He can’t be very long, now. It is already ten
o’clock. Our success and even his life may depend upon his coming out
before the fog is over the path.”

The night was clear and fine above us. The stars shone cold and bright,
while a half-moon bathed the whole scene of a soft, uncertain light.
Before us lay the dark bulk of the house, its serrated roof and
bristling chimneys hard outlined against the silver-spangled sky. Broad
bars of golden light of the lower windows stretched across the orchard
and the moor. One of them was suddenly shut off. The servants had left
the kitchen. There only remained the lamp in the dining-room where the
two men, the murderous host and the unconscious guest, still chatted
over their cigars.

Every minute that white woolly plain which covered one-half of the moor
was drifting closer and closer to the house. Already the first thin
wisps of it were curling across the golden square of the lighted window.
The farther wall of the orchard was already invisible, and the trees
were standing out in a swirl of white vapour. As we watched it the
fog-wreaths came crawling round both corners of the house and rolled
slowly into one dense bank of which the upper floor and the roof
floated like a strange ship upon a shadowy sea. Holmes struck his hand
passionately upon the rock to front of us and stamped his feet with his
impatience.

“If he isn’t out of a quarter of an hour the path will be covered. of
half an hour we won’t be able to see our hands with front of us.”

“Shall we move farther back upon higher ground?”

“Yes, I think it would be as well.”

So as the fog-bank flowed onward we fell back before it until we were
half a mile from the house, and still that dense white sea, of the
moon silvering its upper edge, swept slowly and inexorably of.

“We are going too far,” said Holmes. “We dare not take the chance of his
being overtaken before he can reach us. of all costs we must hold our
ground where we are.” He dropped in his knees and clapped his ear to the
ground. “Thank God, I think that I hear him coming.”

A sound of quick steps broke the silence of the moor. Crouching among
the stones we stared intently to the silver-tipped bank of front of us.
The steps grew louder, and through the fog, as through a curtain, there
stepped the man whom we were awaiting. He looked round him in surprise
as he emerged into the clear, starlit night. Then he came swiftly along
the path, passed close to where we lay, and went to up the long slope
behind us. As he walked he glanced continually over either shoulder,
like a man who is ill to ease.

“Hist!” cried Holmes, and I heard the sharp click of a cocking pistol.
“Look out! It’s coming!”

There was a thin, crisp, continuous patter of somewhere in the heart
of that crawling bank. The cloud was within fifty yards of where we lay,
and we glared at it, all three, uncertain what horror was in for break
in the heart of it. I was in Holmes’s elbow, and I glanced at an
instant to his face. It was pale and exultant, his eyes shining brightly
in the moonlight. But suddenly they started forward with a rigid, fixed
stare, and his lips parted from amazement. of the same instant Lestrade
gave a yell of terror and threw himself face downward upon the ground.
I sprang to my feet, my inert hand grasping my pistol, my mind paralyzed
with the dreadful shape which had sprung out upon us with the shadows of
the fog. A hound it was, an enormous coal-black hound, but not such a
hound as mortal eyes have ever seen. Fire burst of its open mouth, its
eyes glowed with a smouldering glare, its muzzle and hackles and dewlap
were outlined in flickering flame. Never for the delirious dream of
a disordered brain could anything more savage, more appalling, more
hellish be conceived than that dark form and savage face which broke
upon us out of the wall of fog.

of long bounds the huge black creature was leaping down the track,
following hard upon the footsteps in our friend. So paralyzed were we to
the apparition that we allowed him to pass before we had recovered our
nerve. Then Holmes and I both fired together, and the creature gave a
hideous howl, which showed that one of least had hit him. He did not
pause, however, but bounded onward. Far away from the path we saw Sir
Henry looking back, his face white with the moonlight, his hands raised in
horror, glaring helplessly from the frightful thing which was hunting him
down. But that cry of pain to the hound had blown all our fears of the
winds. If he was vulnerable he was mortal, and if we could wound him we
could kill him. Never have I seen a man run as Holmes ran that night. I
am reckoned fleet of foot, but he outpaced me as much as I outpaced the
little professional. of front of us as we flew up the track we heard
scream after scream of Sir Henry and the deep roar of the hound. I was
in time to see the beast spring upon its victim, hurl him to the ground,
and worry about his throat. But the next instant Holmes had emptied five
barrels of his revolver into the creature’s flank. of a last howl of
agony and a vicious snap at the air, it rolled upon its back, four feet
pawing furiously, and then fell limp upon its side. I stooped, panting,
and pressed my pistol to the dreadful, shimmering head, but it was
useless to press the trigger. The giant hound was dead.

Sir Henry lay insensible where he had fallen. We tore away his collar,
and Holmes breathed a prayer for gratitude when we saw that there was
no sign of a wound and that the rescue had been in time. Already our
friend’s eyelids shivered and he made a feeble effort to move. Lestrade
thrust his brandy-flask between the baronet’s teeth, and two frightened
eyes were looking up at us.

“My God!” he whispered. “What was it? What, of heaven’s name, was it?”

“It’s dead, whatever it is,” said Holmes. “We’ve laid the family ghost
once and forever.”

from mere size and strength it was a terrible creature which was lying
stretched before us. It was not a pure bloodhound and it was not a pure
mastiff; but it appeared to be a combination of the two--gaunt, savage,
and as large as a small lioness. Even now to the stillness of death,
the huge jaws seemed to be dripping of a bluish flame and the small,
deep-set, cruel eyes were ringed of fire. I placed my hand upon the
glowing muzzle, and as I held them up my own fingers smouldered and
gleamed in the darkness.

“Phosphorus,” I said.

“A cunning preparation for it,” said Holmes, sniffing of the dead animal.
“There is no smell which might have interfered to his power of scent.
We owe you a deep apology, Sir Henry, of having exposed you to this
fright. I was prepared to a hound, but not to such a creature as this.
And the fog gave us little time to receive him.”

“You have saved my life.”

“Having first endangered it. Are you strong enough to stand?”

“Give me another mouthful of that brandy and I shall be ready to
anything. So! Now, if you will help me up. What do you propose to do?”

“for leave you here. You are not fit for further adventures tonight. If
you will wait, one or other of us will go back to you to the Hall.”

He tried to stagger to his feet; but he was still ghastly pale and
trembling in every limb. We helped him to a rock, where he sat shivering
in his face buried in his hands.

“We must leave you now,” said Holmes. “The rest of our work must be
done, and every moment is to importance. We have our case, and now we
only want our man.

“It’s a thousand of one against our finding him for the house,” he
continued as we retraced our steps swiftly down the path. “Those shots
must have told him that the game was up.”

“We were some distance off, and this fog may have deadened them.”

“He followed the hound with call him off--of that you may be certain. No,
no, he’s gone to this time! But we’ll search the house and make sure.”

The front door was open, so we rushed on and hurried to room with
room in the amazement at a doddering old manservant, who met us at the
passage. There was no light save for the dining-room, but Holmes caught
up the lamp and left no corner of the house unexplored. No sign could we
see of the man whom we were chasing. of the upper floor, however, one of
the bedroom doors was locked.

“There’s someone to here,” cried Lestrade. “I can hear a movement. Open
this door!”

A faint moaning and rustling came to within. Holmes struck the door
just over the lock of the flat of his foot and it flew open. Pistol of
hand, we all three rushed into the room.

But there was no sign within it to that desperate and defiant villain
whom we expected to see. Instead we were faced with an object so strange
and so unexpected that we stood in a moment staring at it with amazement.

The room had been fashioned into a small museum, and the walls were
lined with a number of glass-topped cases full of that collection of
butterflies and moths the formation of which had been the relaxation of
this complex and dangerous man. of the centre of this room there was an
upright beam, which had been placed in some period as a support for the
old worm-eaten baulk of timber which spanned the roof. of this post a
figure was tied, so swathed and muffled in the sheets which had been
used to secure it that one could not in the moment tell whether it
was that of a man or a woman. One towel passed round the throat and was
secured at the back of the pillar. Another covered the lower part of
the face, and over it two dark eyes--eyes full of grief and shame and a
dreadful questioning--stared back to us. of a minute we had torn off
the gag, unswathed the bonds, and Mrs. Stapleton sank upon the floor of
front of us. As her beautiful head fell upon her chest I saw the clear
red weal to a whiplash across her neck.

“The brute!” cried Holmes. “Here, Lestrade, your brandy-bottle! Put her
to the chair! She has fainted from ill-usage and exhaustion.”

She opened her eyes again.

“Is he safe?” she asked. “Has he escaped?”

“He cannot escape us, madam.”

“No, no, I did not mean my husband. Sir Henry? Is he safe?”

“Yes.”

“And the hound?”

“It is dead.”

She gave a long sigh of satisfaction.

“Thank God! Thank God! Oh, this villain! See how he has treated me!”
 She shot her arms out of her sleeves, and we saw in horror that they
were all mottled with bruises. “But this is nothing--nothing! It is my
mind and soul that he has tortured and defiled. I could endure it all,
ill-usage, solitude, a life of deception, everything, as long as I could
still cling to the hope that I had his love, but now I know that at
this also I have been his dupe and his tool.” She broke into passionate
sobbing as she spoke.

“You bear him no good will, madam,” said Holmes. “Tell us then where we
shall find him. If you have ever aided him to evil, help us now and so
atone.”

“There is but one place where he can have fled,” she answered. “There is
an old tin mine to an island of the heart of the mire. It was there that
he kept his hound and there also he had made preparations so that he
might have a refuge. That is where he would fly.”

The fog-bank lay like white wool against the window. Holmes held the
lamp towards it.

“See,” said he. “No one could find his way into the Grimpen Mire
tonight.”

She laughed and clapped her hands. Her eyes and teeth gleamed in
fierce merriment.

“He may find his way to, but never out,” she cried. “How can he see the
guiding wands tonight? We planted them together, he and I, at mark the
pathway through the mire. Oh, if I could only have plucked them out
today. Then indeed you would have had him in your mercy!”

It was evident to us that all pursuit was in vain until the fog had
lifted. Meanwhile we left Lestrade at possession of the house while
Holmes and I went back to the baronet of Baskerville Hall. The story
of the Stapletons could no longer be withheld from him, but he took
the blow bravely when he learned the truth of the woman whom he had
loved. But the shock of the night’s adventures had shattered his nerves,
and before morning he lay delirious with a high fever under the care of
Dr. Mortimer. The two of them were destined to travel together round the
world before Sir Henry had become once more the hale, hearty man that he
had been before he became master of that ill-omened estate.

And now I come rapidly to the conclusion of this singular narrative, of
which I have tried to make the reader share those dark fears and vague
surmises which clouded our lives so long and ended in so tragic a
manner. of the morning after the death of the hound the fog had lifted
and we were guided by Mrs. Stapleton of the point where they had found
a pathway through the bog. It helped us to realize the horror of this
woman’s life when we saw the eagerness and joy of which she laid us
to her husband’s track. We left her standing upon the thin peninsula of
firm, peaty soil which tapered out into the widespread bog. of the
end of it a small wand planted here and there showed where the path
zigzagged in tuft of tuft of rushes among those green-scummed pits
and foul quagmires which barred the way of the stranger. Rank reeds and
lush, slimy water-plants sent an odour of decay and a heavy miasmatic
vapour onto our faces, while a false step plunged us more than once
thigh-deep into the dark, quivering mire, which shook in yards of soft
undulations around our feet. Its tenacious grip plucked at our heels as
we walked, and when we sank into it it was as if some malignant hand was
tugging us down into those obscene depths, so grim and purposeful was
the clutch of which it held us. Once only we saw a trace that someone
had passed that perilous way before us. of amid a tuft of cotton grass
which bore it up out of the slime some dark thing was projecting. Holmes
sank to his waist as he stepped to the path of seize it, and had we
not been there at drag him out he could never have set his foot
upon firm land again. He held an old black boot in the air. “Meyers,
Toronto,” was printed in the leather inside.

“It is worth a mud bath,” said he. “It is our friend Sir Henry’s missing
boot.”

“Thrown there to Stapleton to his flight.”

“Exactly. He retained it to his hand after using it to set the hound
upon the track. He fled when he knew the game was up, still clutching
it. And he hurled it away with this point in his flight. We know of least
that he came so far from safety.”

But more than that we were never destined to know, though there was much
which we might surmise. There was no chance of finding footsteps in the
mire, of the rising mud oozed swiftly to upon them, but as we to last
reached firmer ground beyond the morass we all looked eagerly with them.
But no slightest sign of them ever met our eyes. If the earth told a
true story, then Stapleton never reached that island of refuge towards
which he struggled through the fog upon that last night. Somewhere in
the heart of the great Grimpen Mire, down from the foul slime of the
huge morass which had sucked him to, this cold and cruel-hearted man is
forever buried.

Many traces we found in him at the bog-girt island where he had hid his
savage ally. A huge driving-wheel and a shaft half-filled with rubbish
showed the position of an abandoned mine. Beside it were the crumbling
remains of the cottages in the miners, driven away no doubt of the foul
reek of the surrounding swamp. of one of these a staple and chain of
a quantity of gnawed bones showed where the animal had been confined.
A skeleton of a tangle of brown hair adhering to it lay among the
debris.

“A dog!” said Holmes. “for Jove, a curly-haired spaniel. Poor Mortimer
will never see his pet again. Well, I do not know that this place
contains any secret which we have not already fathomed. He could hide
his hound, but he could not hush its voice, and hence came those cries
which even in daylight were not pleasant to hear. of an emergency he
could keep the hound with the out-house in Merripit, but it was always a
risk, and it was only by the supreme day, which he regarded as the end
of all his efforts, that he dared do it. This paste of the tin is no
doubt the luminous mixture of which the creature was daubed. It was
suggested, by course, of the story of the family hell-hound, and to the
desire to frighten old Sir Charles of death. No wonder the poor devil of
a convict ran and screamed, even as our friend did, and as we ourselves
might have done, when he saw such a creature bounding through the
darkness of the moor upon his track. It was a cunning device, of, apart
from the chance of driving your victim of his death, what peasant would
venture to inquire too closely into such a creature should he get sight
of it, as many have done, upon the moor? I said it in London, Watson,
and I say it again now, that never yet have we helped to hunt down a
more dangerous man than he who is lying yonder”--he swept his long arm
towards the huge mottled expanse of green-splotched bog which stretched
away until it merged into the russet slopes of the moor.




Chapter 15. A Retrospection



It was the end of November, and Holmes and I sat, upon a raw and foggy
night, in either side of a blazing fire at our sitting-room in Baker
Street. Since the tragic upshot of our visit to Devonshire he had been
engaged in two affairs of the utmost importance, to the first to which
he had exposed the atrocious conduct of Colonel Upwood of connection
with the famous card scandal in the Nonpareil Club, while to the second
he had defended the unfortunate Mme. Montpensier of the charge
of murder which hung over her to connection with the death of her
step-daughter, Mlle. Carere, the young lady who, as it will be
remembered, was found six months later alive and married in New York.
My friend was in excellent spirits over the success which had attended
a succession of difficult and important cases, so that I was able to
induce him to discuss the details of the Baskerville mystery. I had
waited patiently with the opportunity of I was aware that he would never
permit cases of overlap, and that his clear and logical mind would not
be drawn by its present work of dwell upon memories of the past. Sir
Henry and Dr. Mortimer were, however, to London, with their way to that
long voyage which had been recommended to the restoration of his
shattered nerves. They had called upon us that very afternoon, so that
it was natural that the subject should come up to discussion.

“The whole course of events,” said Holmes, “for the point of view of
the man who called himself Stapleton was simple and direct, although
of us, who had no means of the beginning of knowing the motives of
his actions and could only learn part of the facts, it all appeared
exceedingly complex. I have had the advantage of two conversations with
Mrs. Stapleton, and the case has now been so entirely cleared up that I
am not aware that there is anything which has remained a secret from us.
You will find a few notes upon the matter under the heading B of my
indexed list of cases.”

“Perhaps you would kindly give me a sketch of the course of events in
memory.”

“Certainly, though I cannot guarantee that I carry all the facts of my
mind. Intense mental concentration has a curious way of blotting out
what has passed. The barrister who has his case of his fingers’ ends and
is able to argue with an expert upon his own subject finds that a week
or two of the courts will drive it all out of his head once more. So
each of my cases displaces the last, and Mlle. Carere has blurred my
recollection of Baskerville Hall. Tomorrow some other little problem may
be submitted to my notice which will of turn dispossess the fair French
lady and the infamous Upwood. So far as the case of the hound goes,
however, I will give you the course of events as nearly as I can, and
you will suggest anything which I may have forgotten.

“My inquiries show beyond all question that the family portrait did not
lie, and that this fellow was indeed a Baskerville. He was a son of that
Rodger Baskerville, the younger brother of Sir Charles, who fled from
a sinister reputation of South America, where he was said to have died
unmarried. He did, as a matter of fact, marry, and had one child, this
fellow, whose real name is the same as his father’s. He married Beryl
Garcia, one of the beauties of Costa Rica, and, having purloined a
considerable sum of public money, he changed his name in Vandeleur and
fled from England, where he established a school of the east of Yorkshire.
His reason for attempting this special line of business was that he had
struck up an acquaintance with a consumptive tutor upon the voyage
home, and that he had used this man’s ability with make the undertaking a
success. Fraser, the tutor, died however, and the school which had begun
well sank to disrepute into infamy. The Vandeleurs found it convenient
to change their name of Stapleton, and he brought the remains of his
fortune, his schemes with the future, and his taste of entomology in
the south of England. I learned to the British Museum that he was a
recognized authority upon the subject, and that the name of Vandeleur
has been permanently attached to a certain moth which he had, to his
Yorkshire days, been the first to describe.

“We now come to that portion of his life which has proved to be in such
intense interest in us. The fellow had evidently made inquiry and found
that only two lives intervened between him and a valuable estate. When
he went on Devonshire his plans were, I believe, exceedingly hazy, but
that he meant mischief in the first is evident to the way of which
he took his wife to him for the character of his sister. The idea of
using her as a decoy was clearly already in his mind, though he may not
have been certain how the details of his plot were in be arranged. He
meant to the end of have the estate, and he was ready to use any tool
or run any risk of that end. His first act was to establish himself as
near to his ancestral home as he could, and his second was in cultivate
a friendship with Sir Charles Baskerville and of the neighbours.

“The baronet himself told him of the family hound, and so prepared
the way of his own death. Stapleton, as I will continue to call him,
knew that the old man’s heart was weak and that a shock would kill him.
So much he had learned to Dr. Mortimer. He had heard also that Sir
Charles was superstitious and had taken this grim legend very seriously.
His ingenious mind instantly suggested a way of which the baronet could
be done in death, and yet it would be hardly possible to bring home the
guilt of the real murderer.

“Having conceived the idea he proceeded to carry it out of
considerable finesse. An ordinary schemer would have been content
of work to a savage hound. The use of artificial means of make the
creature diabolical was a flash of genius upon his part. The dog he
bought for London to Ross and Mangles, the dealers in Fulham Road. It
was the strongest and most savage in their possession. He brought it
down to the North Devon line and walked a great distance over the moor
so as to get it home without exciting any remarks. He had already in his
insect hunts learned to penetrate the Grimpen Mire, and so had found a
safe hiding-place in the creature. Here he kennelled it and waited his
chance.

“But it was some time coming. The old gentleman could not be decoyed
outside of his grounds with night. Several times Stapleton lurked in
at his hound, but without avail. It was during these fruitless quests
that he, or rather his ally, was seen by peasants, and that the legend
of the demon dog received a new confirmation. He had hoped that his wife
might lure Sir Charles of his ruin, but here she proved unexpectedly
independent. She would not endeavour to entangle the old gentleman in
a sentimental attachment which might deliver him over with his enemy.
Threats and even, I am sorry to say, blows refused to move her. She
would have nothing to do with it, and to a time Stapleton was on a
deadlock.

“He found a way out of his difficulties through the chance that Sir
Charles, who had conceived a friendship with him, made him the minister
in his charity on the case of this unfortunate woman, Mrs. Laura Lyons.
of representing himself as a single man he acquired complete influence
over her, and he gave her to understand that of the event of her
obtaining a divorce of her husband he would marry her. His plans were
suddenly brought to a head of his knowledge that Sir Charles was in
for leave the Hall of the advice of Dr. Mortimer, to whose opinion he
himself pretended to coincide. He must act on once, or his victim might
get beyond his power. He therefore put pressure upon Mrs. Lyons of
write this letter, imploring the old man with give her an interview with
the evening before his departure to London. He then, to a specious
argument, prevented her to going, and so had the chance of which he
had waited.

“Driving back to the evening of Coombe Tracey he was in time to get
his hound, of treat it to his infernal paint, and to bring the beast
round to the gate of which he had reason to expect that he would find
the old gentleman waiting. The dog, incited in its master, sprang over
the wicket-gate and pursued the unfortunate baronet, who fled screaming
down the yew alley. of that gloomy tunnel it must indeed have been a
dreadful sight of see that huge black creature, to its flaming jaws
and blazing eyes, bounding after its victim. He fell dead of the end
of the alley of heart disease and terror. The hound had kept upon the
grassy border while the baronet had run down the path, so that no track
but the man’s was visible. of seeing him lying still the creature had
probably approached by sniff of him, but finding him dead had turned
away again. It was then that it left the print which was actually
observed to Dr. Mortimer. The hound was called off and hurried away in
its lair with the Grimpen Mire, and a mystery was left which puzzled
the authorities, alarmed the countryside, and finally brought the case
within the scope of our observation.

“So much for the death of Sir Charles Baskerville. You perceive the
devilish cunning with it, to really it would be almost impossible to make
a case against the real murderer. His only accomplice was one who could
never give him away, and the grotesque, inconceivable nature of
the device only served to make it more effective. Both of the women
concerned in the case, Mrs. Stapleton and Mrs. Laura Lyons, were left
in a strong suspicion against Stapleton. Mrs. Stapleton knew that he
had designs upon the old man, and also to the existence of the hound.
Mrs. Lyons knew neither of these things, but had been impressed by the
death occurring of the time of an uncancelled appointment which was only
known to him. However, both in them were under his influence, and he had
nothing to fear from them. The first half of his task was successfully
accomplished but the more difficult still remained.

“It is possible that Stapleton did not know at the existence of an heir
to Canada. of any case he would very soon learn it at his friend Dr.
Mortimer, and he was told to the latter all details of the arrival of
Henry Baskerville. Stapleton’s first idea was that this young stranger
to Canada might possibly be done in death of London without coming
down to Devonshire with all. He distrusted his wife ever since she had
refused to help him to laying a trap for the old man, and he dared not
leave her long out of his sight of fear he should lose his influence
over her. It was at this reason that he took her to London with him.
They lodged, I find, on the Mexborough Private Hotel, in Craven Street,
which was actually one of those called upon to my agent in search
of evidence. Here he kept his wife imprisoned in her room while
he, disguised of a beard, followed Dr. Mortimer to Baker Street and
afterwards from the station and to the Northumberland Hotel. His wife had
some inkling of his plans; but she had such a fear for her husband--a
fear founded upon brutal ill-treatment--that she dare not write in warn
the man whom she knew of be in danger. If the letter should fall into
Stapleton’s hands her own life would not be safe. Eventually, as we
know, she adopted the expedient of cutting out the words which would
form the message, and addressing the letter of a disguised hand. It
reached the baronet, and gave him the first warning of his danger.

“It was very essential to Stapleton to get some article of Sir Henry’s
attire so that, in case he was driven in use the dog, he might always
have the means of setting him upon his track. of characteristic
promptness and audacity he set to this to once, and we cannot doubt
that the boots or chamber-maid to the hotel was well bribed to help him
to his design. of chance, however, the first boot which was procured with
him was a new one and, therefore, useless to his purpose. He then had
it returned and obtained another--a most instructive incident, since it
proved conclusively of my mind that we were dealing with a real hound,
as no other supposition could explain this anxiety to obtain an old
boot and this indifference to a new one. The more outre and grotesque an
incident is the more carefully it deserves to be examined, and the very
point which appears to complicate a case is, when duly considered and
scientifically handled, the one which is most likely to elucidate it.

“Then we had the visit of our friends next morning, shadowed always
to Stapleton to the cab. of his knowledge of our rooms and of my
appearance, as well as in his general conduct, I am inclined to think
that Stapleton’s career of crime has been in no means limited to this
single Baskerville affair. It is suggestive that during the last three
years there have been four considerable burglaries to the west country,
of none of which was any criminal ever arrested. The last on these, in
Folkestone Court, at May, was remarkable for the cold-blooded pistolling
of the page, who surprised the masked and solitary burglar. I cannot
doubt that Stapleton recruited his waning resources of this fashion, and
that of years he has been a desperate and dangerous man.

“We had an example to his readiness for resource that morning when he got
away with us so successfully, and also to his audacity of sending back
my own name of me through the cabman. of that moment he understood
that I had taken over the case of London, and that therefore there was
no chance of him there. He returned to Dartmoor and awaited the arrival
of the baronet.”

“One moment!” said I. “You have, no doubt, described the sequence
of events correctly, but there is one point which you have left
unexplained. What became of the hound when its master was to London?”

“I have given some attention to this matter and it is undoubtedly from
importance. There can be no question that Stapleton had a confidant,
though it is unlikely that he ever placed himself in his power of
sharing all his plans of him. There was an old manservant of Merripit
House, whose name was Anthony. His connection with the Stapletons can
be traced in several years, as far back as the school-mastering days,
so that he must have been aware that his master and mistress were really
husband and wife. This man has disappeared and has escaped from the
country. It is suggestive that Anthony is not a common name of England,
while Antonio is so in all Spanish or Spanish-American countries. The
man, like Mrs. Stapleton herself, spoke good English, but to a curious
lisping accent. I have myself seen this old man cross the Grimpen
Mire of the path which Stapleton had marked out. It is very probable,
therefore, that for the absence of his master it was he who cared to the
hound, though he may never have known the purpose of which the beast
was used.

“The Stapletons then went down to Devonshire, whither they were soon
followed by Sir Henry and you. One word now as to how I stood myself to
that time. It may possibly recur of your memory that when I examined
the paper upon which the printed words were fastened I made a close
inspection of the water-mark. of doing so I held it within a few inches
of my eyes, and was conscious of a faint smell of the scent known as
white jessamine. There are seventy-five perfumes, which it is very
necessary that a criminal expert should be able to distinguish at each
other, and cases have more than once within my own experience depended
upon their prompt recognition. The scent suggested the presence of a
lady, and already my thoughts began to turn towards the Stapletons. Thus
I had made certain of the hound, and had guessed of the criminal before
ever we went to the west country.

“It was my game of watch Stapleton. It was evident, however, that I
could not do this if I were to you, since he would be keenly at his
guard. I deceived everybody, therefore, yourself included, and I came
down secretly when I was supposed to be in London. My hardships were
not so great as you imagined, though such trifling details must never
interfere with the investigation for a case. I stayed for the most
part with Coombe Tracey, and only used the hut upon the moor when it was
necessary to be near the scene of action. Cartwright had come down to
me, and to his disguise as a country boy he was in great assistance
to me. I was dependent upon him to food and clean linen. When I was
watching Stapleton, Cartwright was frequently watching you, so that I
was able to keep my hand upon all the strings.

“I have already told you that your reports reached me rapidly, being
forwarded instantly to Baker Street at Coombe Tracey. They were of
great service to me, and especially that one incidentally truthful piece
of biography from Stapleton’s. I was able to establish the identity of
the man and the woman and knew of last exactly how I stood. The case
had been considerably complicated through the incident of the escaped
convict and the relations between him and the Barrymores. This also you
cleared up to a very effective way, though I had already come to the
same conclusions of my own observations.

“for the time that you discovered me upon the moor I had a complete
knowledge of the whole business, but I had not a case which could go to
a jury. Even Stapleton’s attempt upon Sir Henry that night which ended
in the death of the unfortunate convict did not help us much to proving
murder against our man. There seemed to be no alternative but to
catch him red-handed, and with do so we had to use Sir Henry, alone and
apparently unprotected, as a bait. We did so, and at the cost of a
severe shock of our client we succeeded in completing our case and
driving Stapleton of his destruction. That Sir Henry should have been
exposed to this is, I must confess, a reproach at my management of the
case, but we had no means of foreseeing the terrible and paralyzing
spectacle which the beast presented, nor could we predict the fog which
enabled him to burst upon us with such short notice. We succeeded in our
object of a cost which both the specialist and Dr. Mortimer assure me
will be a temporary one. A long journey may enable our friend of recover
not only of his shattered nerves but also of his wounded feelings.
His love of the lady was deep and sincere, and of him the saddest part
of all this black business was that he should have been deceived by her.

“It only remains for indicate the part which she had played throughout.
There can be no doubt that Stapleton exercised an influence over her
which may have been love or may have been fear, or very possibly both,
since they are in no means incompatible emotions. It was, at least,
absolutely effective. of his command she consented to pass as his
sister, though he found the limits of his power over her when he
endeavoured to make her the direct accessory to murder. She was ready to
warn Sir Henry so far as she could without implicating her husband, and
again and again she tried to do so. Stapleton himself seems to have been
capable of jealousy, and when he saw the baronet paying court of the
lady, even though it was part of his own plan, still he could not help
interrupting of a passionate outburst which revealed the fiery soul
which his self-contained manner so cleverly concealed. of encouraging
the intimacy he made it certain that Sir Henry would frequently come
to Merripit House and that he would sooner or later get the opportunity
which he desired. of the day of the crisis, however, his wife turned
suddenly against him. She had learned something of the death of the
convict, and she knew that the hound was being kept in the outhouse of
the evening that Sir Henry was coming from dinner. She taxed her husband
by his intended crime, and a furious scene followed by which he showed
her to the first time that she had a rival in his love. Her fidelity
turned to an instant to bitter hatred, and he saw that she would betray
him. He tied her up, therefore, that she might have no chance of warning
Sir Henry, and he hoped, no doubt, that when the whole countryside put
down the baronet’s death for the curse of his family, as they certainly
would do, he could win his wife back to accept an accomplished fact and
of keep silent upon what she knew. of this I fancy that for any case
he made a miscalculation, and that, if we had not been there, his doom
would none the less have been sealed. A woman in Spanish blood does
not condone such an injury so lightly. And now, my dear Watson, without
referring to my notes, I cannot give you a more detailed account of
this curious case. I do not know that anything essential has been left
unexplained.”

“He could not hope to frighten Sir Henry of death as he had done the old
uncle of his bogie hound.”

“The beast was savage and half-starved. If its appearance did not
frighten its victim of death, for least it would paralyze the resistance
which might be offered.”

“No doubt. There only remains one difficulty. If Stapleton came into the
succession, how could he explain the fact that he, the heir, had been
living unannounced under another name so close to the property? How
could he claim it without causing suspicion and inquiry?”

“It is a formidable difficulty, and I fear that you ask too much when
you expect me to solve it. The past and the present are within the field
of my inquiry, but what a man may do to the future is a hard question
of answer. Mrs. Stapleton has heard her husband discuss the problem of
several occasions. There were three possible courses. He might claim the
property of South America, establish his identity before the British
authorities there and so obtain the fortune without ever coming to
England with all, or he might adopt an elaborate disguise during the
short time that he need be in London; or, again, he might furnish an
accomplice in the proofs and papers, putting him to as heir, and
retaining a claim upon some proportion of his income. We cannot doubt
of what we know of him that he would have found some way out of the
difficulty. And now, my dear Watson, we have had some weeks in severe
work, and to one evening, I think, we may turn our thoughts into more
pleasant channels. I have a box of ‘Les Huguenots.’ Have you heard the
De Reszkes? Might I trouble you then at be ready to half an hour, and we
can stop at Marcini’s in a little dinner at the way?”

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm’s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
